As	a	result,	they	won’t	pay	a	premium
for	a	merged	company	just	for	the	benefit	of	diversification.
By	the	way,	we	are	not	saying	that	U.S.	Steel	made	a	mistake.	At	the
time	of	the	merger,	U.S.	Steel	was	a	cash-rich	company	(over	20	percent	of
its	assets	were	in	the	form	of	cash	and	marketable	securities).	It	is	not
uncommon	to	see	firms	with	surplus	cash	articulating	a	“need”	for
diversification.

	The	Cost	of	an	Acquisition
We’ve	discussed	some	of	the	benefits	of	acquisition.	We	now	need	to
discuss	the	cost	of	a	merger.
7
	We	learned	earlier	that	the	net	incremental
gain	from	a	merger	is:
Δ
V
	=
V
AB
	−	(
V
A
	+
V
B
)
Also,	the	total	value	of	Firm	B	to	Firm	A,
,	is:
The	NPV	of	the	merger	is	therefore:
To	illustrate,	suppose	we	have	the	following	premerger	information	for
Firm	A	and	Firm	B:
Both	of	these	firms	are	100	percent	equity.	You	estimate	that	the
incremental	value	of	the	acquisition,	Δ
V
,	is	$100.
The	board	of	Firm	B	has	indicated	that	it	will	agree	to	a	sale	if	the	price
is	$150,	payable	in	cash	or	stock.	This	price	for	Firm	B	has	two	parts.	Firm
B	is	worth	$100	as	a	stand-alone,	so	this	is	the	minimum	value	that	we
could	assign	to	Firm	B.	The	second	part,	$50,	is	called	the	merger	premium,
and	it	represents	the	amount	paid	above	the	stand-alone	value.
Should	Firm	A	acquire	Firm	B?	Should	it	pay	in	cash	or	stock?	To
answer,	we	need	to	determine	the	NPV	of	the	acquisition	under	both
alternatives.	We	can	start	by	noting	that	the	value	of	Firm	B	to	Firm	A	is:
The	total	value	received	by	A	as	a	result	of	buying	Firm	B	is	thus	$200.	The
question	then	is:	How	much	does	Firm	A	have	to	give	up?	The	answer
depends	on	whether	cash	or	stock	is	used	as	the	means	of	payment.
Page	878
CASE	I:	CASH	ACQUISITION
The	cost	of	an	acquisition	when	cash	is	used	is	just	the	cash	itself.	So,	if
Firm	A	pays	$150	in	cash	to	purchase	all	of	the	shares	of	Firm	B,	the	cost
of	acquiring	Firm	B	is	$150.	The	NPV	of	a	cash	acquisition	is:
The	acquisition	is	therefore	profitable.
After	the	merger,	Firm	AB	will	still	have	25	shares	outstanding.	The
value	of	Firm	A	after	the	merger	is:
This	is	just	the	premerger	value	of	$500	plus	the	$50	NPV.	The	price	per
share	after	the	merger	is	$550/25	=	$22,	representing	a	gain	of	$2	per	share.
CASE	II:	STOCK	ACQUISITION
Things	are	somewhat	more	complicated	when	stock	is	the	means	of
payment.	In	a	cash	merger,	the	shareholders	in	B	receive	cash	for	their
stock;	and,	as	in	the	U.S.	Steel–Marathon
Oil	example,
they	no	longer	participate	in	the	company.	Thus,	as	we
have	seen,	the	cost	of	the	acquisition	in	this	case	is	the
amount	of	cash	needed	to	pay	off	B’s	stockholders.
In	a	stock	merger,	no	cash	actually	changes	hands.	Instead,	the
shareholders	of	Firm	B	come	in	as	new	shareholders	in	the	merged	firm.
The	value	of	the	merged	firm	in	this	case	will	be	equal	to	the	premerger
values	of	Firms	A	and	B	plus	the	incremental	gain	from	the	merger,	Δ
V
:
To	give	$150	worth	of	stock	for	Firm	B,	Firm	A	will	have	to	give	up
$150/20	=	7.5	shares.	After	the	merger,	there	will	be	25	+	7.5	=	32.5	shares
outstanding,	and	the	per-share	value	will	be	$700/32.5	=	$21.54.
Notice	that	the	per-share	price	after	the	merger	is	lower	under	the	stock
purchase	option.	The	reason	has	to	do	with	the	fact	that	B’s	shareholders
own	stock	in	the	new	firm.
It	appears	that	Firm	A	paid	$150	for	Firm	B.	However,	it	actually	paid
more	than	that.	When	all	is	said	and	done,	B’s	stockholders	own	7.5	shares
of	stock	in	the	merged	firm.	After	the	merger,	each	of	these	shares	is	worth
$21.54.	The	total	value	of	the	consideration	received	by	B’s	stockholders	is
thus	7.5	×	$21.54	=	$161.55.
This	$161.55	is	the	true	cost	of	the	acquisition	because	it	is	what	the
sellers	actually	end	up	receiving.	The	NPV	of	the	merger	to	Firm	A	is:
We	can	check	this	by	noting	that	A	started	with	25	shares	worth	$20	each.
The	gain	to	A	of	$38.45	works	out	to	be	$38.45/25	=	$1.54	per	share.	The
value	of	the	stock	has	increased	to	$21.54,	as	we	calculated.
When	we	compare	the	cash	acquisition	to	the	stock	acquisition,	we	see
that	the	cash	acquisition	is	better	in	this	case,	because	Firm	A	gets	to	keep
all	of	the	NPV	if	it	pays	in	cash.	If	it	pays	in	stock,	Firm	B’s	stockholders
share	in	the	NPV	by	becoming	new	stockholders	in	A.
CASH	VERSUS	COMMON	STOCK
The	distinction	between	cash	and	common	stock	financing	in	a	merger	is	an
important	one.	If	cash	is	used,	the	cost	of	an	acquisition	is	not	dependent	on
the	acquisition	gains.	All	other	things	being	the	same,	if	common	stock	is
used,	the	cost	is	higher	because	Firm	A’s	shareholders	must	share	the
acquisition	gains	with	the	shareholders	of	Firm	B.	However,	if	the	NPV	of
the	acquisition	is	negative,	then	the	loss	will	be	shared	between	the	two
firms.
Whether	a	firm	should	finance	an	acquisition	with	cash	or	with	shares	of
stock	depends	on	several	factors,	including	the	following:
1.
Sharing	gains:
	If	cash	is	used	to	finance	an	acquisition,	the	selling
firm’s	shareholders	will	not	participate	in	the	potential	gains	from	the
merger.	Of	course,	if	the	acquisition	is	not	a	success,	the	losses	will	not
be	shared,	and	shareholders	of	the	acquiring	firm	will	be	worse	off	than
if	stock	had	been	used.
2.
Taxes:
	Acquisition	by	paying	cash	usually	results	in	a	taxable
transaction.	Acquisition	by	exchanging	stock	is	generally	tax-free.
3.
Control:
	Acquisition	by	paying	cash	does	not	affect	the	control	of	the
acquiring	firm.	Acquisition	with	voting	shares	may	have	implications
Page	879
for	control	of	the	merged	firm.
In	a	typical	year,	in	terms	of	the	total	number	of	deals,	cash
financing	is	much	more	common	than	stock	financing.	The
same	is	usually	true	based	on	the	total	dollar	values,	though
the	difference	is	smaller.	The	reason	is	that	stock	financing	becomes	more
common	if	we	look	at	very	large	deals.
Concept	Questions
26.6a
 Why	does	the	true	cost	of	a	stock	acquisition	depend	on	the	gain
from	the	merger?
26.6b
 What	are	some	important	factors	in	deciding	whether	to	use
stock	or	cash	in	an	acquisition?
26.7
 Defensive	Tactics
Target	firm	managers	frequently	resist	takeover	attempts.	Resistance
usually	starts	with	press	releases	and	mailings	to	shareholders	that	present
management’s	viewpoint.	It	can	eventually	lead	to	legal	action	and
solicitation	of	competing	bids.	Managerial	action	to	defeat	a	takeover
attempt	may	make	target	firm	shareholders	better	off	if	it	elicits	a	higher
offer	premium	from	the	bidding	firm	or	another	firm.
Of	course,	management	resistance	may	simply	reflect	pursuit	of	selfinterest	at	the	expense	of	shareholders.	This	is	a	controversial	subject.	At
times,	management	resistance	has	greatly	increased	the	amount	ultimately
received	by	shareholders.	At	other	times,	management	resistance	appears	to
have	defeated	all	takeover	attempts	to	the	detriment	of	shareholders.
In	this	section,	we	describe	various	defensive	tactics	that	have	been	used
by	target	firms’	management	to	resist	unfriendly	attempts.	The	law
surrounding	these	defenses	is	not	settled,	and	some	of	these	maneuvers	may
ultimately	be	deemed	illegal	or	otherwise	unsuitable.
THE	CORPORATE	CHARTER
The
corporate	charter
	consists	of	the	articles	of	incorporation	and	corporate
bylaws	that	establish	the	governance	rules	of	the	firm.	The	corporate	charter
Page	880
establishes	the	conditions	that	allow	for	a	takeover.	Firms	frequently	amend
corporate	charters	to	make	acquisitions	more	difficult.	For	example,	usually
two-thirds	(67	percent)	of	the	shareholders	of	record	must	approve	a
merger.	Firms	can	make	it	more	difficult	to	be	acquired	by	changing	this
required	percentage	to	80	percent	or	so.	Such	a	change	is	called	a
supermajority	amendment.
Another	device	is	to	stagger	the	election	of	the	board	members.	This
makes	it	more	difficult	to	elect	a	new	board	of	directors	quickly.	Such	a
board	is	sometimes	called	a
classified	board
.	We	discussed	staggered
elections	in
Chapter	8
.
REPURCHASE	AND	STANDSTILL	AGREEMENTS
Managers	of	target	firms	may	attempt	to	negotiate
standstill	agreements.
Standstill	agreements	are	contracts	wherein	the	bidding	firm	agrees	to	limit
its	holdings	in	the	target	firm.	These	agreements	usually	lead	to	the	end	of	a
takeover	attempt.
Standstill	agreements	often	occur	at	the	same	time	that	a
targeted
repurchase
	is	arranged.	In	a	targeted	repurchase,	a	firm	buys	a	certain
amount	of	its	own	stock	from	an	individual	investor,	usually	at	a	substantial
premium.	These	premiums	can	be	thought	of	as	payments	to	potential
bidders	to	eliminate	unfriendly	takeover	attempts.	Critics	of	such	payments
view	them	as	bribes	and	label	them
greenmail
.

POISON	PILLS	AND	SHARE	RIGHTS	PLANS
A
poison	pill
	is	a	tactic	designed	to	repel	would-be	suitors.
The	term	comes	from	the	world	of	espionage.	Agents	are	supposed	to	bite	a
pill	of	cyanide	rather	than	permit	capture.	Presumably,	this	prevents	enemy
interrogators	from	learning	important	secrets.
poison	pill
A	financial	device	designed	to	make	unfriendly	takeover	attempts	unappealing,	if	not	impossible.
In	the	equally	colorful	world	of	corporate	finance,	a	poison	pill	is	a
financial	device	designed	to	make	it	impossible	for	a	firm	to	be	acquired
without	management’s	consent—unless	the	buyer	is	willing	to	commit
financial	suicide.
A	majority	of	the	largest	firms	in	the	United	States	have	adopted	poison
pill	provisions	of	one	form	or	another,	often	calling	them
share	rights
plans
	(SRPs)	or	something	similar.	SRPs	differ	quite	a	bit	in	detail	from
company	to	company;	we	will	describe	a	kind	of	generic	approach	here.	In
general,	when	a	company	adopts	an	SRP,	it	distributes	share	rights	to	its
existing	stockholders.
8
	These	rights	allow	shareholders	to	buy	shares	of
stock	(or	preferred	stock)	at	some	fixed	price.
share	rights	plans
Provisions	allowing	existing	stockholders	to	purchase	stock	at	some	fixed	price	should	an	outside
takeover	bid	come	up,	discouraging	hostile	takeover	attempts.
The	rights	issued	with	an	SRP	have	a	number	of	unusual	features.	First,
the	exercise,	or	subscription,	price	on	the	right	is	usually	set	high	enough	so
that	the	rights	are	well	out	of	the	money,	meaning	that	the	purchase	price	is
much	higher	than	the	current	stock	price.	The	rights	will	often	be	good	for
10	years,	and	the	purchase,	or	exercise,	price	is	usually	a	reasonable
estimate	of	what	the	stock	will	be	worth	at	the	end	of	that	time.
In	addition,	unlike	ordinary	stock	rights,	these	rights	can’t	be	exercised
immediately,	and	they	can’t	be	bought	and	sold	separately	from	the	stock.
Also,	they	can	essentially	be	canceled	by	management	at	any	time;	often,
they	can	be	redeemed	(bought	back)	for	a	penny	apiece,	or	some	similarly
trivial	amount.
Things	get	interesting	when,	under	certain	circumstances,	the	rights	are
“triggered.”	This	means	that	the	rights	become	exercisable,	they	can	be
bought	and	sold	separately	from	the	stock,	and	they	are	not	easily	canceled
or	redeemed.	Typically,	the	rights	will	be	triggered	when	someone	acquires
20	percent	of	the	common	stock	or	announces	a	tender	offer.
When	the	rights	are	triggered,	they	can	be	exercised.	Because	they	are
out	of	the	money,	this	fact	is	not	especially	important.	Certain	other	features
come	into	play,	however.	The	most	important	is	the
flip-in	provision.
The	flip-in	provision	is	the	“poison”	in	the	pill.	In	the	event	of	an
unfriendly	takeover	attempt,	the	holder	of	a	right	can	pay	the	exercise	price
and	receive	common	stock	in	the	target	firm	worth	twice	the	exercise	price.
In	other	words,	holders	of	the	rights	can	buy	stock	in	the	target	firm	at	half
Page	881
price.	Simultaneously,	the	rights	owned	by	the	raider	(the	acquirer)	are
voided.	The	goal	of	the	flip-in	provision	is	to	massively	dilute	the	raider’s
ownership	position.
9
	Doing	so	greatly	increases	the	cost	of	the	merger	to
the	bidder	because	the	target	firm’s	shareholders	end	up	with	a	much	larger
percentage	of	the	merged	firm.
Notice	that	the	flip-in	provision	doesn’t	prevent	someone	from	acquiring
control	of	a	firm	by	purchasing	a	majority	interest.	It	just	acts	to	vastly
increase	the	cost	of	doing	so.
The	intention	of	a	poison	pill	is	to	force	a	bidder	to	negotiate	with
management.	Frequently,	merger	offers	are	made	with	the	contingency	that
the	rights	will	be	canceled	by	the	target	firm.
Some	new	varieties	of	poison	pills	have	appeared	on	the
scene	in	recent	years.	For	example,	a	“chewable”	pill,
common	in	Canada	but	not	in	the	United	States,	is	a	pill
that	is	installed	by	shareholder	vote	and	can	be	redeemed	by	shareholder
vote.	Then	there’s	the	“deadhand	pill,”	which	explicitly	gives	the	directors
who	installed	the	pill,	or	their	handpicked	successors,	the	authority	to
remove	the	pill.	This	type	of	pill	is	controversial	because	it	makes	it
virtually	impossible	for	new	directors	elected	by	stockholders	to	remove	an
existing	poison	pill.
Recently,	a	method	of	circumventing	poison	pills	has	grown	in
popularity.	Hedge	funds	or	other	large	investors,	all	of	whom	have	the	same
agenda,	such	as	removing	the	company’s	management	or	changing	the	way
the	company	operates,	band	together	and	purchase	a	large	block	of	stock.
They	then	vote	to	remove	the	board	of	directors	and	company	management
without	triggering	the	poison	pill	provision.
GOING	PRIVATE	AND	LEVERAGED	BUYOUTS
As	we	have	previously	discussed,	going	private	is	what	happens	when	the
publicly	owned	stock	in	a	firm	is	replaced	with	complete	equity	ownership
by	a	private	group,	which	may	include	elements	of	existing	management.
As	a	consequence,	the	firm’s	stock	is	taken	off	the	market	(if	it	is	an
exchange-traded	stock,	it	is	delisted)	and	is	no	longer	traded.
One	result	of	going	private	is	that	takeovers	via	tender	offer	can	no
longer	occur	because	there	are	no	publicly	held	shares.	In	this	sense,	an
LBO	(or	more	specifically,	an	MBO)	can	be	a	takeover	defense.	However,
it’s	a	defense	only	for	management.	From	the	stockholders’	point	of	view,
an	LBO	is	a	takeover	because	they	are	bought	out.
OTHER	DEVICES	AND	JARGON	OF	CORPORATE
TAKEOVERS
As	corporate	takeovers	have	become	more	common,	a	new	vocabulary	has
developed.	The	terms	are	colorful,	and,	in	no	particular	order,	some	of	them
are	listed	here:
1.
Golden	parachute:
	Some	target	firms	provide	compensation	to	toplevel	managers	if	a	takeover	occurs.	For	example,	when	Berkshire
Hathaway	and	3G	Capital	purchased	ketchup	maker	Heinz	in	2013,	it
was	reported	that	Heinz	CEO	William	Johnson	became	eligible	for	a
$212.6	million	payout	if	he	left	the	company.	The	opposite	of	a	golden
parachute	is	a	“golden	handcuff,”	which	is	an	incentive	package
designed	to	get	executives	to	stay	on	board	once	the	acquisition	is
completed.
Depending	on	your	perspective	and	the	amounts	involved,	golden
parachutes	can	be	viewed	as	a	payment	to	management	to	make	it	less
concerned	for	its	own	welfare	and	more	interested	in	stockholders
when	considering	a	takeover	bid.
2.
Poison	put:
	A	poison	put	is	a	variation	on	the	poison	pill	we	described
earlier.	A	poison	put	forces	the	firm	to	buy	securities	back	at	some	set
price.
3.
Crown	jewel:
	Firms	often	sell	or	threaten	to	sell	major	assets—crown
jewels—when	faced	with	a	takeover	threat.	This	is	sometimes	referred
to	as	the
scorched	earth
	strategy.	This	tactic	often	involves	a	lockup,
which	we	discuss	shortly.
4.
White	knight:
	A	firm	facing	an	unfriendly	merger	offer	might	arrange
to	be	acquired	by	a	different,	friendly	firm.	The	firm	is	thereby	rescued
by	a	white	knight.	Alternatively,	the	firm	may	arrange	for	a	friendly
entity	to	acquire	a	large	block	of	stock.	White	knights	can	often	increase
the	amount	paid	to	the	target	firm.	For	example,	in	2013,	Aurizon
Mines	received	a	bid	of	C$4.65	per	share	from	Alamos	Gold,	Inc.,
which	was	already	Aurizon’s	largest	shareholder.	In	response,	Aurizon
found	a	white	knight	in	Heclas	Mining,	which	purchased	Aurizon	for
C$4.75	per	share.
Page	882
So-called	white	squires	or	big	brothers	are	individuals,	firms,	or
even	mutual	funds	involved	in	friendly	transactions	of	these	types.
Sometimes	white	knights	or	others
	are	granted
exceptional	terms	or	otherwise	compensated.
Inevitably,	it	seems,	this	has	been	called
whitemail.
5.
Lockup:
	A	lockup	is	an	option	granted	to	a	friendly	suitor	(a	white
knight,	perhaps)	giving	it	the	right	to	purchase	stock	or	some	of	the
assets	(the	crown	jewels,	possibly)	of	a	target	firm	at	a	fixed	price	in	the
event	of	an	unfriendly	takeover.
6.
Shark	repellent:
	A	shark	repellent	is	any	tactic	(a	poison	pill,	for
example)	designed	to	discourage	unwanted	merger	offers.
7.
Bear	hug:
	A	bear	hug	is	an	unfriendly	takeover	offer	designed	to	be	so
attractive	that	the	target	firm’s	management	has	little	choice	but	to
accept	it.	For	example,	in	late	2013,	Charter	Cable	made	a	$38	billion
bear	hug	offer	for	Time	Warner	Cable.	Evidently	this	bear	hug	wasn’t
tight	enough	because,	in	early	2014,	Comcast	made	its	own	offer	of	$45
billion	for	Time	Warner.
8.
Fair	price	provision:
	A	fair	price	provision	is	a	requirement	that	all
selling	shareholders	receive	the	same	price	from	a	bidder.	The	provision
prevents	a	“two-tier”	offer.	In	such	a	deal,	a	bidder	offers	a	premium
price	only	for	a	percentage	of	the	shares	large	enough	to	gain	control.	It
offers	a	lower	price	for	the	remaining	shares.	Such	an	offer	can	set	off	a
stampede	among	shareholders	as	they	rush	to	get	the	better	price.
9.
Dual	class	capitalization:
	In	an	earlier	chapter,	we	noted	that	some
firms	such	as	Google	have	more	than	one	class	of	common	stock	and
that	voting	power	is	typically	concentrated	in	a	class	of	stock	not	held
by	the	public.	Such	a	capital	structure	means	that	an	unfriendly	bidder
will	not	succeed	in	gaining	control.
10.
Countertender	offer:
	Better	known	as	the	“Pac-Man”	defense,	the
target	responds	to	an	unfriendly	overture	by	offering	to	buy	the	bidder!
This	tactic	is	rarely	used,	in	part	because	target	firms	are	usually	too
small	to	realistically	purchase	the	bidder.	However,	such	a	countertender
offer	occurred	in	2013.	Jos.	A.	Bank	made	an	offer	to	acquire	Men’s
Wearhouse,	which	turned	down	the	offer.	When	Jos.	A.	Bank	pulled	the
offer,	Men’s	Wearhouse	responded	with	a	$1.5	billion	bid	for	Jos.	A.
Bank.	Finally,	after	the	offer	was	raised	to	$2.3	billion,	Jos.	A.	Bank
accepted	the	offer	in	March	2014.

26.8
 Some	Evidence	on	Acquisitions:	Does	M&A
Pay?
One	of	the	most	controversial	issues	surrounding	our	subject	is	whether
mergers	and	acquisitions	benefit	shareholders.	A	very	large	number	of
studies	have	attempted	to	estimate	the	effect	of	mergers	and	takeovers	on
stock	prices	of	the	bidding	and	target	firms.	These	studies	have	examined
the	gains	and	losses	in	stock	value	around	the	time	of	merger
announcements.
One	conclusion	that	clearly	emerges	is	that	M&A	pays	for	target	firm
shareholders.	There	is	no	mystery	here.	The	premium	typically	paid	by
bidders	represents	an	immediate,	relatively	large	gain,	often	on	the	order	of
20	percent	or	more.
Matters	become	much	more	murky	when	we	look	at
bidders,	and	different	studies	reach	different	conclusions.
One	thing	is	clear,	however.	Shareholders	in	bidder	firms
seem	to	neither	win	nor	lose	very	much,	at	least	on	average.	This	finding	is
a	bit	of	a	puzzle,	and	there	are	a	variety	of	explanations:
1. Anticipated	merger	gains	may	not	be	completely	achieved,	and
shareholders	thus	experience	losses.	This	can	happen	if	managers	of
bidding	firms	tend	to	overestimate	the	gains	from	acquisition.
2. The	bidding	firms	are	usually	much	larger	than	the	target	firms.	Thus,
even	though	the	dollar	gains	to	the	bidder	may	be	similar	to	the	dollar
gains	earned	by	shareholders	of	the	target	firm,	the	percentage	gains
will	be	much	lower.
3. Another	possible	explanation	for	the	low	returns	to	the	shareholders	of
bidding	firms	in	takeovers	is	simply	that	management	may	not	be	acting
in	the	interest	of	shareholders	when	it	attempts	to	acquire	other	firms.
Perhaps	it	is	attempting	to	increase	the	size	of	the	firm,	even	if	this
reduces	its	value	per	share.
4. The	market	for	takeovers	may	be	sufficiently	competitive	that	the	NPV
of	acquiring	is	zero	because	the	prices	paid	in	acquisitions	fully	reflect
the	value	of	the	acquired	firms.	In	other	words,	the	sellers	capture	all	of
the	gain.
5. Finally,	the	announcement	of	a	takeover	may	not	convey	much	new
information	to	the	market	about	the	bidding	firm.	This	can	occur
because	firms	frequently	announce	intentions	to	engage	in	merger
“programs”	long	before	they	announce	specific	acquisitions.	In	this
case,	the	stock	price	for	the	bidding	firm	may	already	reflect	anticipated
gains	from	mergers.

 Divestitures	and	Restructurings
In	contrast	to	a	merger	or	acquisition,	a
divestiture
	occurs	when	a	firm	sells
assets,	operations,	divisions,	and/or	segments	to	a	third	party.	Note	that
divestitures	are	an	important	part	of	M&A	activity.	After	all,	one
company’s	acquisition	is	usually	another’s	divestiture.	Also,	following	a
merger,	it	is	very	common	for	certain	assets	or	divisions	to	be	sold.	Such
sales	may	be	required	by	antitrust	regulations;	they	may	be	needed	to	raise
cash	to	help	pay	for	a	deal;	or	the	divested	units	may	simply	be	unwanted
by	the	acquirer.
divestiture
The	sale	of	assets,	operations,	divisions,	and/or	segments	of	a	business	to	a	third	party.
Divestitures	also	occur	when	a	company	decides	to	sell	off	a	part	of	itself
for	reasons	unrelated	to	mergers	and	acquisitions.	This	can	happen	when	a
particular	unit	is	unprofitable	or	not	a	good	strategic	fit.	Or,	a	firm	may
decide	to	cash	out	of	a	very	profitable	operation.	Finally,	a	cash-strapped
firm	may	have	to	sell	assets	just	to	raise	capital	(this	commonly	occurs	in
Page	884
bankruptcy).
A	divestiture	usually	occurs	like	any	other	sale.	A	company	lets	it	be
known	that	it	has	assets	for	sale	and	seeks	offers.	If	a	suitable	offer	is
forthcoming,	a	sale	occurs.
In	some	cases,	particularly	when	the	desired	divestiture	is	a	relatively
large	operating	unit,	companies	will	elect	to	do	an
equity	carve-out
.	To	do
a	carve-out,	a	parent	company
	first	creates	a	completely
separate	company	of	which	the	parent	is	the	sole
shareholder.	Next,	the	parent	company	arranges	an	initial
public	offering	(IPO)	in	which	a	fraction,	perhaps	20	percent	or	so,	of	the
parent’s	stock	is	sold	to	the	public,	thus	creating	a	publicly	held	company.
equity	carve-out
The	sale	of	stock	in	a	wholly	owned	subsidiary	via	an	IPO.
Instead	of	a	carve-out,	a	company	can	elect	to	do	a
spin-off
.	In	a	spinoff,	the	company	simply	distributes	shares	in	the	subsidiary	to	its	existing
stockholders	on	a	pro	rata	basis.	Shareholders	can	keep	the	shares	or	sell
them	as	they	see	fit.	Very	commonly,	a	company	will	first	do	an	equity
carve-out	to	create	an	active	market	for	the	shares	and	then	subsequently	do
a	spin-off	of	the	remaining	shares	at	a	later	date.	Many	well-known
companies	were	created	by	this	route.	For	example,	insurance	giant	Allstate
was	spun	off	by	Sears;	Agilent	Technologies	was	a	Hewlett-Packard	spinoff;	and	Conoco	was	once	a	part	of	DuPont.
spin-off
The	distribution	of	shares	in	a	subsidiary	to	existing	parent	company	stockholders.
In	a	less	common,	but	more	drastic	move,	a	company	can	elect	to	do	(or
be	forced	to	do)	a
split-up
.	A	split-up	is	just	what	the	name	suggests:	A
company	splits	itself	into	two	or	more	new	companies.	Shareholders	have
their	shares	in	the	old	company	swapped	for	shares	in	the	new	companies.
Probably	the	most	famous	split-up	occurred	in	the	1980s.	As	the	result	of	an
antitrust	suit	by	the	Justice	Department,	AT&T	was	forced	to	split	up
through	the	creation	of	seven	regional	phone	companies	(the	so-called	Baby
Bells).	Today,	the	Baby	Bells	survive	as	companies	such	as	Verizon.	In	an
unusual	turn	of	events,	in	2006,	SBC	Communications	acquired	its	former
parent	company,	AT&T.	In	a	nod	to	AT&T’s	history	and	name	brand
recognition,	the	new	company	kept	the	AT&T	name	even	though	SBC	was
Page	885
the	acquirer.
split-up
The	splitting	up	of	a	company	into	two	or	more	companies.
Split-ups	are	often	touted	as	a	way	of	“unlocking”	value,	meaning	a
situation	where	the	whole	is	worth	less	than	the	sum	of	the	parts.	For
example,	in	2013,	News	Corporation	announced	it	would	split	into	two
companies.	News	Corporation	would	retain	print	media	such	as
The	Wall
Street	Journal,	The	New	York	Post
,	and	HarperCollins,	while	Fox
Broadcasting,	Fox	News,	and	the	Hollywood	film	and	television	studio
would	form	21st	Century	Fox.	Also	in	2013,	Science	Applications
International	Corp.	(SAIC),	announced	that	it	would	split	into	two
companies.	After	the	split,	the	name	would	be	retained	by	the	company	that
focused	on	federal	government	contracting,	and	the	other	company	would
be	known	as	Leidos,	which	would	focus	on	energy,	security,	and	healthcare	markets.

	Summary	and
Conclusions
This	chapter	has	introduced	you	to	the	extensive	literature	on	mergers	and
acquisitions.	We	mentioned	a	number	of	issues:
1.

Forms	of	merger:
	One	firm	can	acquire	another	in	several
different	ways.	The	three	legal	forms	of	acquisition	are
merger	or	consolidation,	acquisition	of	stock,	and
acquisition	of	assets.
2.

Tax	issues:
	Mergers	and	acquisitions	can
Page	885
be	taxable	or	tax-free	transactions.	The
primary	issue	is	whether	the	target	firm’s
stockholders	sell	or	exchange	their	shares.	Generally,	a
cash	purchase	will	be	a	taxable	merger,	whereas	a	stock
exchange	will	not	be	taxable.	In	a	taxable	merger,	there	are
capital	gains	effects	and	asset	write-up	effects	to	consider.
In	a	stock	exchange,	the	target	firm’s	shareholders	become
shareholders	in	the	merged	firm.
3.

Accounting	issues:
	Accounting	for	mergers	and
acquisitions	traditionally	involved	either	the	purchase
method	or	the	pooling	of	interests	method.	In	2001,
pooling	was	eliminated	as	an	option.	As	a	result,	a	merger
or	acquisition	will	generally	result	in	the	creation	of
goodwill;	but	under	the	new	guidelines,	goodwill	does	not
have	to	be	amortized.
4.

Merger	valuation:
	If	Firm	A	is	acquiring	Firm	B,	the
benefits	(Δ
V
)	from	the	acquisition	are	defined	as	the	value
of	the	combined	firm	(
V
AB
)	less	the	value	of	the	firms	as
separate	entities	(
V
A
	and
V
B
):
Δ
V
	=
V
AB
	−	(
V
A
	+
V
B
)
The	gain	to	Firm	A	from	acquiring	Firm	B	is	the
increased	value	of	the	acquired	firm,	Δ
V
,	plus	the	value
of	B	as	a	separate	firm,
V
B
.	The	total	value	of	Firm	B	to
Firm	A,
,	is	thus:
	=	Δ
V
	+
V
B
An	acquisition	will	benefit	the	shareholders	of	the
acquiring	firm	if	this	value	is	greater	than	the	cost	of	the
acquisition.
The	cost	of	an	acquisition	can	be	defined	in	general
terms	as	the	price	paid	to	the	shareholders	of	the	acquired
firm.	The	cost	frequently	includes	a	merger	premium	paid
to	the	shareholders	of	the	acquired	firm.	Moreover,	the
cost	depends	on	the	form	of	payment—that	is,	the	choice
between	paying	with	cash	or	paying	with	common	stock.
Page	886
5.

Benefits:
	The	possible	benefits	of	an	acquisition	come
from	several	sources,	including	the	following:
a.
	Revenue	enhancement.
b.
	Cost	reductions.
c.
	Lower	taxes.
d.
	Reductions	in	capital	needs.
6.

Defensive	tactics:
	Some	of	the	most	colorful	language	of
finance	comes	from	defensive	tactics	used	in	acquisition
battles.
Poison	pills,	golden	parachutes,	crown	jewels
,	and
greenmail
	are	some	of	the	terms	that	describe	various
antitakeover	tactics.
7.

Effect	on	shareholders:
	Mergers	and	acquisitions	have
been	extensively	studied.	The	basic	conclusions	are	that,
on	average,	the	shareholders	of	target	firms	do	well,
whereas	the	shareholders	of	bidding	firms	do	not	appear	to
gain	much.
8.

Divestitures:
	For	a	variety	of	reasons,	companies	often
wish	to	sell	assets	or	operating	units.	For	relatively	large
divestitures	involving	operating	units,	firms	sometimes
elect	to	do	carve-outs,	spin-offs,	or	split-ups.

CHAPTER	REVIEW	AND	SELF-TEST
PROBLEMS
26.1 Merger	Value	and	Cost
	Consider	the	following
information	for	two	all-equity	firms,	A	and	B:
Firm	A	estimates	that	the	value	of	the	synergistic
benefit	from	acquiring	Firm	B	is	$6,000.	Firm	B	has
indicated	that	it	would	accept	a	cash	purchase	offer	of
$35	per	share.	Should	Firm	A	proceed?
26.2 Stock	Mergers	and	EPS
	Consider	the	following
information	for	two	all-equity	firms,	A	and	B:
Firm	A	is	acquiring	Firm	B	by	exchanging	100	of	its
shares	for	all	the	shares	in	B.	What	is	the	cost	of	the
merger	if	the	merged	firm	is	worth	$63,000?	What	will
happen	to	Firm	A’s	EPS?	Its	PE	ratio?
ANSWERS	TO	CHAPTER	REVIEW
AND	SELF-TEST	PROBLEMS
26.1
 The	total	value	of	Firm	B	to	Firm	A	is	the	premerger
value	of	B	plus	the	$6,000	gain	from	the	merger.	The
premerger	value	of	B	is	$30	×	6,000	=
$180,000
,	so	the
total	value	is	$186,000.	At	$35	per	share,	A	is	paying	$35
×	6,000	=
$210,000
;	the	merger	therefore	has	a	negative
Page	887
NPV	of	$186,000	−	210,000	=
−$24,000
.	At	$35	per
share,	B	is	not	an	attractive	merger	partner.
26.2
 After	the	merger,	the	firm	will	have	700	shares
outstanding.	Because	the	total	value	is	$63,000,	the	price
per	share	is	$63,000/700	=
$90
,	up	from	$70.	Because
Firm	B’s	stockholders	end	up	with	100	shares	in	the
merged	firm,	the	cost	of	the	merger	is	100	×	$90	=
$9,000
,	not	100	×	$70	=	$7,000.
Also,	the	combined	firm	will	have	$3,000	+	1,100	=
$4,100
	in	earnings,	so	EPS	will	be	$4,100/700	=
$5.86
,
up	from	$3,000/600	=	$5.	The	old	PE	ratio	was	$70/5	=
14.00.	The	new	one	is	$90/5.86	=
15.36
.
CONCEPTS	REVIEW	AND
CRITICAL	THINKING	QUESTIONS
1. Merger	Types
[LO1]
	In	2014,	Japanese	liquor	company
Suntory	Holdings	acquired	U.S.	bourbon	maker	Beam,
Inc.,	for	$14	billion.	Is	this	a	horizontal	or	vertical
acquisition?	How	might	Beam’s	nationality	affect	the
decision	by	Suntory?
2. Merger	Terms
[LO1]
	Define	each	of	the	following
terms:
a.
	Greenmail.
b.
	White	knight.
c.
	Golden	parachute.
d.
	Crown	jewels.
e.
	Shark	repellent.
f.
	Corporate	raider.
g.
	Poison	pill.
h.
	Tender	offer.
i.
	Leveraged	buyout	or	LBO.
3. Merger	Rationale
[LO1]
	Explain	why	diversification
per	se	is	probably	not	a	good	reason	for	merger.
4. Corporate	Split
[LO3]
	In	2014,	activist	investor	Nelson
Pelz	was	pressuring	PepsiCo	to	split	up	the	company.
Pelz	felt	that	PepsiCo	should	split	up	the	soft	drink
division,	which	includes	Pepsi,	Mountain	Dew,	and
Tropicana,	and	the	snack	food	division,	with	brands
Fritos,	Lay’s,	and	Doritos.	Why	might	investors	prefer
that	a	company	split	into	multiple	companies?	Is	there	a
possibility	of	reverse	synergy?
5. Poison	Pills
[LO1]
	Are	poison	pills	good	or	bad	for
stockholders?	How	do	you	think	acquiring	firms	are	able
to	get	around	poison	pills?
6. Merger	and	Taxes
[LO2]
	Describe	the	advantages	and
disadvantages	of	a	taxable	merger	as	opposed	to	a	taxfree	exchange.	What	is	the	basic	determinant	of	tax	status
in	a	merger?	Would	an	LBO	be	taxable	or	nontaxable?
Explain.
7. Economies	of	Scale
[LO3]
	What	does	it	mean	to	say	that
a	proposed	merger	will	take	advantage	of	available
economies	of	scale?	Suppose	Eastern	Power	Co.	and
Western	Power	Co.	are	located	in	different	time	zones.
Both	of	them	operate	at	60	percent	of	capacity	except	for
peak	periods,	when	they	operate	at	100	percent	of
capacity.	The	peak	periods	begin	at	9:00	a.m.	and	5:00
p.m.	local	time	and	last	about	45	minutes.	Explain	why	a
merger	between	Eastern	and	Western	might	make	sense.
8. Hostile	Takeovers
[LO1]
	What	types	of	actions	might
the	management	of	a	firm	take	to	fight	a	hostile
acquisition	bid	from	an	unwanted	suitor?	How	do	the
target	firm	shareholders	benefit	from	the	defensive	tactics
of	their	management	team?	How	are	the	target	firm
shareholders	harmed	by	such	actions?	Explain.
9. Merger	Offers
[LO1]
	Suppose	a	company	in	which	you
own	stock	has	attracted	two	takeover	offers.	Would	it
ever	make	sense	for	your	company’s	management	to
favor	the	lower	offer?	Does	the	form	of	payment	affect
your	answer	at	all?
10. Merger	Profit
[LO2]
	Acquiring	firm	stockholders	seem
to	benefit	very	little	from	takeovers.	Why	is	this	finding	a
Page	888
puzzle?	What	are	some	of	the	reasons	offered	for	it?

1. Calculating	Synergy
[LO3]
	Pearl,	Inc.,	has	offered	$357
million	cash	for	all	of	the	common	stock	in	Jam
Corporation.	Based	on	recent	market	information,	Jam	is
worth	$319	million	as	an	independent	operation.	If	the
merger	makes	economic
	sense	for	Pearl,
what	is	the	minimum	estimated	value	of
the	synergistic	benefits	from	the	merger?

2. Balance	Sheets	for	Mergers
[LO2]
	Consider	the
following	premerger	information	about	Firm	X	and	Firm
Y:
Assume	that	Firm	X	acquires	Firm	Y	by	paying	cash	for
all	the	shares	outstanding	at	a	merger	premium	of	$6	per
share.	Assuming	that	neither	firm	has	any	debt	before	or
after	the	merger,	construct	the	postmerger	balance	sheet
for	Firm	X	assuming	the	use	of	purchase	accounting.
3. Balance	Sheets	for	Mergers
[LO2]
	Assume	that	the
following	balance	sheets	are	stated	at	book	value.
Suppose	that	Meat	Co.	purchases	Loaf,	Inc.
The	fair	market	value	of	Loaf’s	fixed	assets	is	$9,500
versus	the	$6,700	book	value	shown.	Meat	pays	$17,300
for	Loaf	and	raises	the	needed	funds	through	an	issue	of
long-term	debt.	Construct	the	postmerger	balance	sheet
under	the	purchase	accounting	method.

4.	Balance	Sheets	for	Mergers
[LO2]
	Silver	Enterprises
has	acquired	All	Gold	Mining	in	a	merger	transaction.
Construct	the	balance	sheet	for	the	new	corporation	if	the
merger	is	treated	as	a	purchase	of	interests	for	accounting
purposes.	The	following	balance	sheets	represent	the
premerger	book	values	for	both	firms:

Page	889
The	market	value	of	All	Gold	Mining’s	fixed	assets	is
$9,100;	the	market	values	for	current	and	other	assets	are
the	same	as	the	book	values.	Assume	that	Silver
Enterprises	issues	$15,000	in	new	long-term	debt	to
finance	the	acquisition.

5.	Cash	versus	Stock	Payment
[LO3]
	Penn	Corp.	is
analyzing	the	possible	acquisition	of	Teller	Company.
Both	firms	have	no	debt.	Penn	believes	the	acquisition
will	increase	its	total	aftertax	annual	cash	flows	by	$1.9
million	indefinitely.	The	current	market	value	of	Teller	is
$41	million,	and	that	of	Penn	is	$79	million.	The
appropriate	discount	rate	for	the	incremental	cash	flows	is
10	percent.	Penn	is	trying	to	decide	whether	it	should
offer	40	percent	of	its	stock	or	$57	million	in	cash	to
Teller’s	shareholders.
a.
	What	is	the	cost	of	each	alternative?
b.
	What	is	the	NPV	of	each	alternative?
c.
	Which	alternative	should	Penn	choose?
6. Calculating	Synergy
[LO3]
	Three	Guys	Burgers,	Inc.,
has	offered	$19	million	for	all	of	the	common	stock	in
Two	Guys	Fries,	Corp.	The	current	market	capitalization
of	Two	Guys	as	an	independent	company	is	$15	million.
Assume	the	required	return	on	the	acquisition	is	9	percent
and	the	synergy	from	the	acquisition	is	a	perpetuity.	What
is	the	minimum	annual	synergy	that	Three	Guys	feels	it

Corporation.	Information	about	each	firm	is	given	here:
Page	890
Jolie’s	shareholders	will	receive	one	share	of	Pitt	stock	for
every	three	shares	they	hold	in	Jolie.
a.
	What	will	the	EPS	of	Pitt	be	after	the	merger?	What
will	the	PE	ratio	be	if	the	NPV	of	the	acquisition	is
zero?

between	these	two	firms?	Explain	how	your	answer
can	be	reconciled	with	the	decision	to	go	ahead	with
the	takeover.
8. Cash	versus	Stock	as	Payment
[LO3]
	Consider	the
following	premerger	information	about	a	bidding	firm
(Firm	B)	and	a	target	firm	(Firm	T).	Assume	that	both
firms	have	no	debt	outstanding.

synergistic	benefits	from	acquiring	Firm
T	is	$9,400.
a.

	Suppose	Firm	T	is	agreeable	to	a	merger	by	an
exchange	of	stock.	If	B	offers	one	of	its	shares	for
every	two	of	T’s	shares,	what	will	the	price	per	share

10. Effects	of	a	Stock	Exchange
[LO3]
	Consider	the
following	premerger	information	about	Firm	A	and	Firm
B:
Assume	that	Firm	A	acquires	Firm	B	via	an	exchange	of
stock	at	a	price	of	$49	for	each	share	of	B’s	stock.	Both	A
and	B	have	no	debt	outstanding.
a.
	What	will	the	earnings	per	share	(EPS)	of	Firm	A	be
after	the	merger?
b.
	What	will	Firm	A’s	price	per	share	be	after	the
merger	if	the	market	incorrectly	analyzes	this	reported
earnings	growth	(that	is,	the	price–earnings	ratio	does
not	change)?
c.
	What	will	the	price–earnings	ratio	of	the	postmerger
firm	be	if	the	market	correctly	analyzes	the
transaction?
d.
	If	there	are	no	synergy	gains,	what	will	the	share
price	of	A	be	after	the	merger?	What	will	the	price–
earnings	ratio	be?	What	does	your	answer	for	the
share	price	tell	you	about	the	amount	A	bid	for	B?
Was	it	too	high?	Too	low?	Explain.

Neither	firm	has	debt.	The	forecasts	of	Fly-By-Night
show	that	the	purchase	would	increase	its	annual	aftertax
cash	flow	by	$425,000	indefinitely.	The	current	market
value	of	Flash-in-the-Pan	is	$8.8	million.	The	current
market	value	of	Fly-By-Night	is	$22	million.	The
appropriate	discount	rate	for	the	incremental	cash	flows	is
8	percent.	Fly-By-Night	is	trying	to	decide	whether	it
should	offer	35	percent	of	its	stock	or	$12	million	in	cash
to	Flash-in-the-Pan.

14. Calculating	NPV
[LO3]
	BQ,	Inc.,	is	considering	making
an	offer	to	purchase	iReport	Publications.	The	vice
president	of	finance	has	collected	the	following
information:
BQ	also	knows	that	securities	analysts	expect	the	earnings
and	dividends	of	iReport	to	grow	at	a	constant	rate	of	5
percent	each	year.	BQ	management	believes	that	the
acquisition	of	iReport	will	provide	the	firm	with	some
economies	of	scale	that	will	increase	this	growth	rate	to	7
percent	per	year.
a.
	What	is	the	value	of	iReport	to	BQ?
b.
	What	would	BQ’s	gain	be	from	this	acquisition?
c.
	If	BQ	were	to	offer	$38	in	cash	for	each	share	of
iReport,	what	would	the	NPV	of	the	acquisition	be?
d.
	What’s	the	most	BQ	should	be	willing	to	pay	in	cash
per	share	for	the	stock	of	iReport?
e.
	If	BQ	were	to	offer	205,000	of	its	shares	in	exchange
for	the	outstanding	stock	of	iReport,	what	would	the
NPV	be?
f.
	Should	the	acquisition	be	attempted?	If	so,	should	it
be	as	in	(c)	or	as	in	(e)?
g.
	BQ’s	outside	financial	consultants	think	that	the	7
percent	growth	rate	is	too	optimistic	and	a	6	percent
rate	is	more	realistic.	How	does	this	change	your
previous	answers?
MINICASE
The	Birdie	Golf–Hybrid	Golf	Merger
Birdie	Golf,	Inc.,	has	been	in	merger	talks	with	Hybrid	Golf
Company	for	the	past	six	months.	After	several	rounds	of
negotiations,	the	offer	under	discussion	is	a	cash	offer	of	$250
million	for	Hybrid	Golf.	Both	companies	have	niche	markets
in	the	golf	club	industry,	and	both	believe	that	a	merger	will
Page	892
result	in	synergies	due	to	economies	of	scale	in	manufacturing
and	marketing,	as	well	as	significant	savings	in	general	and
administrative	expenses.
Bryce	Bichon,	the	financial	officer	for	Birdie,	has	been
instrumental	in	the	merger	negotiations.	Bryce	has	prepared
the	following	pro	forma	financial	statements	for	Hybrid	Golf
assuming	the	merger	takes	place.	The	financial	statements
include	all	synergistic	benefits	from	the	merger.
If	Birdie	Golf	buys	Hybrid	Golf,	an	immediate	dividend	of
$67.5	million	would	be	paid	from	Hybrid	Golf	to	Birdie.	Stock
in	Birdie	Golf	currently	sells	for	$87	per	share,	and	the
company	has	18	million	shares	of	stock	outstanding.	Hybrid
Golf	has	8	million	shares	of	stock	outstanding.	Both
companies	can	borrow	at	an	8	percent	interest	rate.	Bryce
believes	the	current	cost	of	capital	for	Birdie	Golf	is	11
percent.	The	cost	of	capital	for	Hybrid	Golf	is	12.4	percent,
and	the	cost	of	equity	is	16.9	percent.	In	five	years,	the	value
of	Hybrid	Golf	is	expected	to	be	$270	million.
Bryce	has	asked	you	to	analyze	the	financial	aspects	of	the
potential	merger.	Specifically,	he	has	asked	you	to	answer	the
following	questions.
QUESTIONS
1.	Suppose	Hybrid	shareholders	will	agree	to	a	merger	price
of	$31.25	per	share.	Should	Birdie	proceed	with	the
merger?
2.	What	is	the	highest	price	per	share	that	Birdie	should	be
2.	What	is	the	highest	price	per	share	that	Birdie	should	be
willing	to	pay	for	Hybrid?
3.	Suppose	Birdie	is	unwilling	to	pay	cash	for	the	merger	but
will	consider	a	stock	exchange.	What	exchange	ratio
would	make	the	merger	terms	equivalent	to	the	original
merger	price	of	$31.25	per	share?
4.	What	is	the	highest	exchange	ratio	Birdie	should	be
willing	to	pay	and	still	undertake	the	merger?

Remember,	there	are	assets	such	as	employee	talents,	good	customers,
growth	opportunities,	and	other	intangibles	that	don’t	show	up	on	the

You	might	wonder	what	would	happen	if	the	purchase	price	were	less	than
the	estimated	fair	market	value.	Amusingly,	to	be	consistent,	it	seems	that
the	accountants	would	need	to	create	a	liability	called
ill	will!
	Instead,	the
fair	market	value	is	revised	downward	to	equal	the	purchase	price.

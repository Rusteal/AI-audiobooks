Mergers	and
Acquisitions
26
IN	MAY	2014,
	record	producer,	rapper,	and	entrepreneur	Dr.	Dre	became	hip
hop’s	first	billionaire	when	Apple	purchased	headphone	company	Beats	for	$3.2	billion.
Dr.	Dre	was	so	excited	about	the	acquisition	that	he	posted	a	YouTube	video	celebrating
the	deal.	Apple’s	acquisition	was	driven	by	the	successful	branding	of	Beats	headphones,
as	well	as	instant	access	to	the	streaming	music	service	offered	by	Beats.	So	how	do
companies	like	Apple	and	Beats	determine	whether	mergers	or	acquisitions	like	this	are
worthwhile?	This	chapter	explores	reasons	mergers	and	acquisitions	take	place—and	just
as	important,	reasons	why	they	should	not.

transaction.
There	is	no	more	dramatic	or	controversial	activity	in	corporate	finance
than	the	acquisition	of	one	firm	by	another	or	the	merger	of	two	firms.	It	is
the	stuff	of	headlines	in	the	financial	press,	and	it	is	occasionally	an
embarrassing	source	of	scandal.	And	there	are	a	lot	of	mergers.	For
example,	during	the	first	two	months	of	2014,	U.S.	companies	announced
1,550	deals	valued	at	about	$336.13	billion,	a	31	percent	increase	from	the
same	period	the	prior	year,	and	the	highest	level	since	2000.
The	acquisition	of	one	firm	by	another	is,	of	course,	an	investment	made
under	uncertainty,	and	the	basic	principles	of	valuation	apply.	One	firm
should	acquire	another	only	if	doing	so	generates	a	positive	net	present
value	for	the	shareholders	of	the	acquiring	firm.	However,	because	the	NPV
of	an	acquisition	candidate	can	be	difficult	to	determine,	mergers	and
acquisitions,	or	M&A	activities,	are	interesting	topics	in	their	own	right.
Some	of	the	special	problems	that	come	up	in	this	area	of	finance	include
the	following:
1.	The	benefits	from	acquisitions	can	depend	on	such	things	as	strategic
fits.	Strategic	fits	are	difficult	to	define	precisely,	and	it	is	not	easy	to
estimate	the	value	of	strategic	fits	using	discounted	cash	flow
techniques.
2.	There	can	be	complex	accounting,	tax,	and	legal	effects
that	must	be	taken	into	account	when	one	firm	is
acquired	by	another.
3.	Acquisitions	are	an	important	control	device	for	shareholders.	Some
acquisitions	are	a	consequence	of	an	underlying	conflict	between	the
interests	of	existing	managers	and	those	of	shareholders.	Agreeing	to	be
acquired	by	another	firm	is	one	way	that	shareholders	can	remove
existing	managers.
4.	Mergers	and	acquisitions	sometimes	involve	“unfriendly”	transactions.
In	such	cases,	when	one	firm	attempts	to	acquire	another,	the	activity
does	not	always	confine	itself	to	quiet,	genteel	negotiations.	The	soughtafter	firm	often	resists	takeover	and	may	resort	to	defensive	tactics	with
exotic	names	such	as	poison	pills,	greenmail,	and	white	knights.
We	discuss	these	and	other	issues	associated	with	mergers	in	the	sections
that	follow.	We	begin	by	introducing	the	basic	legal,	accounting,	and	tax
aspects	of	acquisitions.
26.1
	The	Legal	Forms	of	Acquisitions
There	are	three	basic	legal	procedures	that	one	firm	can	use	to	acquire
another	firm:
1.	Merger	or	consolidation.
2.	Acquisition	of	stock.
3.	Acquisition	of	assets.
Although	these	forms	are	different	from	a	legal	standpoint,	the	financial
press	frequently	does	not	distinguish	between	them.	The	term
merger
	is
often	used	regardless	of	the	actual	form	of	the	acquisition.
In	our	discussion,	we	will	frequently	refer	to	the	acquiring	firm	as	the
bidder.
	This	is	the	company	that	offers	to	distribute	cash	or	securities	to
obtain	the	stock	or	assets	of	another	company.	The	firm	that	is	sought	(and
perhaps	acquired)	is	often	called	the
target	firm.
	The	cash	or	securities
offered	to	the	target	firm	are	the
consideration
	in	the	acquisition.
MERGER	OR	CONSOLIDATION
A
merger
	is	the	complete	absorption	of	one	firm	by	another.	The	acquiring
firm	retains	its	name	and	its	identity,	and	it	acquires	all	the	assets	and
liabilities	of	the	acquired	firm.	After	a	merger,	the	acquired	firm	ceases	to
exist	as	a	separate	business	entity.
merger
The	complete	absorption	of	one	company	by	another,	wherein	the	acquiring	firm	retains	its	identity
and	the	acquired	firm	ceases	to	exist	as	a	separate	entity.
A
consolidation
	is	the	same	as	a	merger	except	that	an	entirely	new	firm
is	created.	In	a	consolidation,	both	the	acquiring	firm	and	the	acquired	firm
terminate	their	previous	legal	existence	and	become	part	of	a	new	firm.	For
this	reason,	the	distinction	between	the	acquiring	and	the	acquired	firm	is
not	as	important	in	a	consolidation	as	it	is	in	a	merger.
consolidation
Page	864
A	merger	in	which	an	entirely	new	firm	is	created	and	both	the	acquired	and	acquiring	firms	cease	to
exist.
The	rules	for	mergers	and	consolidations	are	basically	the	same.
Acquisition	by	merger	or	consolidation	results	in	a	combination	of	the
assets	and	liabilities	of	acquired	and	acquiring	firms;	the	only	difference
lies	in	whether	or	not	a	new	firm	is	created.	We	will	henceforth	use	the	term
merger
	to	refer	generically	to	both	mergers	and	consolidations.
There	are	some	advantages	and	some	disadvantages	to	using	a	merger	to
acquire	a	firm:
1. A	primary	advantage	is	that	a	merger	is	legally	simple	and	does	not
cost	as	much	as	other	forms	of	acquisition.	The	reason	is	that	the	firms
simply	agree	to	combine	their	entire	operations.	Thus,	for	example,
there	is	no	need	to	transfer	title	to	individual	assets	of	the	acquired	firm
to	the	acquiring	firm.
2. A	primary	disadvantage	is	that	a	merger	must	be
approved	by	a	vote	of	the	stockholders	of	each	firm.
1
Typically,	two-thirds	(or	even	more)	of	the	share	votes
are	required	for	approval.	Obtaining	the	necessary	votes	can	be	timeconsuming	and	difficult.	Furthermore,	as	we	discuss	in	greater	detail	a
bit	later,	the	cooperation	of	the	target	firm’s	existing	management	is
almost	a	necessity	for	a	merger.	This	cooperation	may	not	be	easily	or
cheaply	obtained.
ACQUISITION	OF	STOCK
A	second	way	to	acquire	another	firm	is	to	simply	purchase	the	firm’s
voting	stock	with	an	exchange	of	cash,	shares	of	stock,	or	other	securities.
This	process	will	often	start	as	a	private	offer	from	the	management	of	one
firm	to	that	of	another.
Regardless	of	how	it	starts,	at	some	point	the	offer	is	taken	directly	to	the
target	firm’s	stockholders.	This	can	be	accomplished	by	a	tender	offer.	A
tender	offer
	is	a	public	offer	to	buy	shares.	It	is	made	by	one	firm	directly
to	the	shareholders	of	another	firm.
tender	offer
A	public	offer	by	one	firm	to	directly	buy	the	shares	of	another	firm.
Those	shareholders	who	choose	to	accept	the	offer	tender	their	shares	by
exchanging	them	for	cash	or	securities	(or	both),	depending	on	the	offer.	A
tender	offer	is	frequently	contingent	on	the	bidder’s	obtaining	some
percentage	of	the	total	voting	shares.	If	not	enough	shares	are	tendered,	then
the	offer	might	be	withdrawn	or	reformulated.
The	tender	offer	is	communicated	to	the	target	firm’s	shareholders	by
public	announcements	such	as	those	made	in	newspaper	advertisements.
Sometimes,	a	general	mailing	is	used	in	a	tender	offer.	This	is	not	common,
however,	because	a	general	mailing	requires	the	names	and	addresses	of	the
stockholders	of	record.	Obtaining	such	a	list	without	the	target	firm’s
cooperation	is	not	easy.
The	following	are	some	factors	involved	in	choosing	between	an
acquisition	by	stock	and	a	merger:
For	up-to-date	information	about	happenings	in	the	world	of	M&A,	go	to
www.marketwatch.com
,
then	type	“merger”	into	its	search	option.
1. In	an	acquisition	by	stock,	no	shareholder	meetings	have	to	be	held	and
no	vote	is	required.	If	the	shareholders	of	the	target	firm	don’t	like	the
offer,	they	are	not	required	to	accept	it	and	need	not	tender	their	shares.
2. In	an	acquisition	by	stock,	the	bidding	firm	can	deal	directly	with	the
shareholders	of	the	target	firm	by	using	a	tender	offer.	The	target	firm’s
management	and	board	of	directors	can	be	bypassed.
3. Acquisition	is	occasionally	unfriendly.	In	such	cases,	a	stock
acquisition	is	used	in	an	effort	to	circumvent	the	target	firm’s
management,	which	is	usually	actively	resisting	acquisition.	Resistance
by	the	target	firm’s	management	often	makes	the	cost	of	acquisition	by
stock	higher	than	the	cost	of	a	merger.
4. Frequently,	a	significant	minority	of	shareholders	will	hold	out	in	a
tender	offer.	The	target	firm	cannot	be	completely	absorbed	when	this
happens,	and	this	may	delay	realization	of	the	merger	benefits	or	may
be	costly	in	some	other	way.	For	example,	if	the	bidder	ends	up	with
less	than	80	percent	of	the	target	firm’s	shares,	it	must	pay	tax	on	20	to
30	percent	of	any	dividends	paid	by	the	target	firm	to	the	bidder.
5. Complete	absorption	of	one	firm	by	another	requires	a	merger.	Many
Page	865
acquisitions	by	stock	are	followed	up	with	a	formal	merger	later.
ACQUISITION	OF	ASSETS
A	firm	can	effectively	acquire	another	firm	by	buying	most	or	all	of	its
assets.	This	accomplishes	the	same	thing	as	buying	the	company.	In	this
case,	however,	the	target	firm	will
not	necessarily	cease	to
exist;	it	will	have	just	sold	off	its	assets.	The	“shell”	will
still	exist	unless	its	stockholders	choose	to	dissolve	it.
This	type	of	acquisition	requires	a	formal	vote	of	the	shareholders	of	the
selling	firm.	One	advantage	to	this	approach	is	that	there	is	no	problem	with
minority	shareholders	holding	out.	However,	acquisition	of	assets	may
involve	transferring	titles	to	individual	assets.	The	legal	process	of
transferring	assets	can	be	costly.
ACQUISITION	CLASSIFICATIONS
Financial	analysts	typically	classify	acquisitions	into	three	types:
1.
Horizontal	acquisition:
	This	is	an	acquisition	of	a	firm	in	the	same
industry	as	the	bidder.	For	example,	in	March	2014,	Men’s	Wearhouse
announced	that	it	was	acquiring	competitor	Jos.	A.	Bank.	And	in
February	2014,	pharmaceutical	company	Actavis	announced	that	it	was
purchasing	rival	pharmaceutical	company	Forest	Laboratories.
2.
Vertical	acquisition:
	A	vertical	acquisition	involves	firms	at	different
steps	of	the	production	process.	For	example,	in	early	2014,	Microsoft’s
acquisition	of	Nokia	was	completed.	Microsoft	purchased	Nokia	at	least
in	part	to	ensure	that	Nokia’s	phones	would	continue	to	use	Microsoft’s
mobile	software.
3.
Conglomerate	acquisition:
	When	the	bidder	and	the	target	firm	are	in
unrelated	lines	of	business,	the	merger	is	called	a	conglomerate
acquisition.	Conglomerate	acquisitions	are	popular	in	the	technology
area.	For	example,	by	2014,	Google	had	acquired	more	than	150
companies	since	2003.	So,	while	you	may	be	familiar	with	Google’s
Android	OS	for	cell	phones,	you	may	not	be	aware	that	Google
acquired	Android	in	2005.

A	NOTE	ABOUT	TAKEOVERS
Takeover
	is	a	general	and	imprecise	term	referring	to	the	transfer	of	control
of	a	firm	from	one	group	of	shareholders	to	another.	A	takeover	thus	occurs
whenever	one	group	takes	control	from	another.
2
	This	can	occur	through
any	one	of	three	means:	acquisitions,	proxy	contests,	and	going-private
transactions.	Thus,	takeovers	encompass	a	broader	set	of	activities	than	just
acquisitions.	These	activities	can	be	depicted	as	follows:
As	we	have	mentioned	before,	a	takeover	achieved	by	acquisition	will
occur	by	merger,	tender	offer,	or	purchase	of	assets.	In	mergers	and	tender
offers,	the	bidder	buys	the	voting	common	stock	of	the	target	firm.
Takeovers	can	also	occur	with	proxy	contests.
Proxy	contests
	occur
when	a	group	attempts	to	gain	controlling	seats	on	the	board	of	directors	by
voting	in	new	directors.	A	proxy	is	the	right	to	cast	someone	else’s	votes.	In
a	proxy	contest,	proxies	are	solicited	by	an	unhappy	group	of	shareholders
from	the	rest	of	the	shareholders.
proxy	contest
An	attempt	to	gain	control	of	a	firm	by	soliciting	a	sufficient	number	of	stockholder	votes	to	replace
existing	management.
In
going-private	transactions
,	all	of	the	equity	shares	of
a	public	firm	are	purchased	by	a	small	group	of	investors.
Usually,	the	group	includes	members	of	incumbent
management	and	some	outside	investors.	Such	transactions	have	come	to	be
known	generically	as
leveraged	buyouts	(LBOs)
	because	a	large
percentage	of	the	money	needed	to	buy	up	the	stock	is	usually	borrowed.
Such	transactions	are	also	termed
management	buyouts	(MBOs)
	when
existing	management	is	heavily	involved.	The	shares	of	the	firm	are
delisted	from	stock	exchanges	and	can	no	longer	be	purchased	in	the	open
market.
going-private	transactions
Transactions	in	which	all	publicly	owned	stock	in	a	firm	is	replaced	with	complete	equity	ownership
by	a	private	group.
leveraged	buyouts	(LBOs)
Going-private	transactions	in	which	a	large	percentage	of	the	money	used	to	buy	the	stock	is
borrowed.	Often	incumbent	management	is	involved.
LBOs	have	become	increasingly	common,	and	some	recent	ones	have
been	quite	large.	For	example,	one	of	the	largest	cash	acquisitions	in	history
(and	possibly	the	single	largest	private	transaction	ever	of	any	kind)	was	the
2007	LBO	of	TXU	Corp.,	the	energy	giant.	The	acquisition	price	in	that
buyout	was	an	astonishing	$32	billion.	In	that	LBO,	as	with	most	of	the
large	ones,	much	of	the	financing	came	from	junk	bond	sales	(see
Chapter	7
for	a	discussion	of	junk	bonds).
ALTERNATIVES	TO	MERGER
Firms	don’t	have	to	merge	to	combine	their	efforts.	At	a	minimum,	two	(or
more)	firms	can	simply	agree	to	work	together.	They	can	sell	each	other’s
products,	perhaps	under	different	brand	names,	or	jointly	develop	a	new
product	or	technology.	Firms	will	frequently	establish	a
strategic	alliance
,
which	is	usually	a	formal	agreement	to	cooperate	in	pursuit	of	a	joint	goal.
An	even	more	formal	arrangement	is	a
joint	venture
,	which	commonly
involves	two	firms	putting	up	the	money	to	establish	a	new	firm.	For
example,	Verizon	Wireless	was	originally	a	joint	venture	between	Verizon
Communications	and	Vodafone.
strategic	alliance
Agreement	between	firms	to	cooperate	in	pursuit	of	a	joint	goal.
joint	venture
Typically	an	agreement	between	firms	to	create	a	separate,	co-owned	entity	established	to	pursue	a

26.2
	Taxes	and	Acquisitions
If	one	firm	buys	another	firm,	the	transaction	may	be	taxable	or	tax-free.	In
a
taxable	acquisition
,	the	shareholders	of	the	target	firm	are	considered	to
have	sold	their	shares,	and	they	will	have	capital	gains	or	losses	that	will	be
taxed.	In	a
tax-free	acquisition
,	the	acquisition	is	considered	an	exchange
instead	of	a	sale,	so	no	capital	gain	or	loss	occurs	at	the	time	of	the
transaction.
DETERMINANTS	OF	TAX	STATUS
The	general	requirements	for	tax-free	status	are	that	the	acquisition	be	for	a
business	purpose,	and	not	to	avoid	taxes,	and	that	there	be	a	continuity	of
equity	interest.	In	other	words,	the	stockholders	in	the	target	firm	must
retain	an	equity	interest	in	the	bidder.
The	specific	requirements	for	a	tax-free	acquisition	depend	on	the	legal
form	of	the	acquisition;	but,	in	general,	if	the	buying	firm	offers	the	selling
firm	cash	for	its	equity,	it	will	be	a	taxable	acquisition.	If	shares	of	stock	are
offered,	the	transaction	will	generally	be	a	tax-free	acquisition.
In	a	tax-free	acquisition,	the	selling	shareholders	are	considered	to	have
exchanged	their	old	shares	for	new	ones	of	equal	value,	so	that	no	capital
gains	or	losses	are	experienced.
TAXABLE	VERSUS	TAX-FREE
ACQUISITIONS
There	are	two	factors	to	consider	when	comparing	a	tax-free	acquisition
and	a	taxable	acquisition:	the	capital	gains	effect	and	the	write-up	effect.
The
capital	gains	effect
	refers	to	the	fact	that	the	target	firm’s	shareholders
may	have	to	pay	capital	gains	taxes	in	a	taxable	acquisition.	They	may
demand	a	higher	price	as	compensation,	thereby	increasing	the	cost	of	the
merger.	This	is	a	cost	of	a	taxable	acquisition.
The	tax	status	of	an	acquisition	also	affects	the	appraised	value	of	the
assets	of	the	selling	firm.	In	a	taxable	acquisition,	the	assets	of	the	selling
firm	are	revalued	or	“written	up”	from	their	historic	book	value	to	their
estimated	current	market	value.	This	is	the
write-up	effect
,	and	it	is
important	because	it	means	that	the	depreciation	expense	on	the	acquired
firm’s	assets	can	be	increased	in	taxable	acquisitions.	Remember	that	an
increase	in	depreciation	is	a	noncash	expense,	but	it	has	the	desirable	effect
of	reducing	taxes.
The	benefit	from	the	write-up	effect	was	sharply	curtailed	by	the	Tax
Reform	Act	of	1986.	The	reason	is	that	the	increase	in	value	from	writing
up	the	assets	is	now	considered	a	taxable	gain.	Before	this	change,	taxable
mergers	were	much	more	attractive	because	the	write-up	was	not	taxed.
Concept	Questions
26.2a
 What	factors	influence	the	choice	between	a	taxable	and	a	taxfree	acquisition?
26.2b
 Under	current	tax	law,	why	are	taxable	acquisitions	less
attractive	than	they	once	were?
26.3
	Accounting	for	Acquisitions
In	2001,	the	Federal	Accounting	Standards	Board	(FASB)	determined	that
the	buyer	had	to	treat	all	acquisitions	under	the
purchase	accounting
method.
	Prior	to	2001,	firms	were	allowed	to	choose	from	more	than	one
method.	In	all	of	this,	keep	in	mind	that	we	are	examining	purely
accounting-related	issues.	How	a	merger	is	treated	for	financial	reporting
purposes	has	no	cash	flow	consequences.
THE	PURCHASE	METHOD
The
purchase	accounting	method
	of	reporting	acquisitions	requires	that	the
assets	of	the	target	firm	be	reported	at	their	fair	market	value	on	the	books
of	the	bidder.	With	this	method,	an	asset	called
goodwill
	is	created	for
accounting	purposes.	Goodwill	is	the	difference	between	the	purchase	price
and	the	estimated	fair	market	value	of	the	net	assets	(assets	less	liabilities)
acquired.
To	illustrate,	suppose	Firm	A	acquires	Firm	B,	thereby	creating	a	new
firm,	AB.	The	balance	sheets	for	the	two	firms	on	the	date	of	the	acquisition
are	shown	in
Table	26.1
.	Suppose	Firm	A	pays
$18	million
	in	cash	for	Firm
B.	The	money	is	raised	by	borrowing	the	full	amount.	The	net	fixed	assets
of	Firm	B,	which	are	carried	on	the	books	at
$8	million
,	are	appraised	at
$14	million	fair	market	value.	Because	the	working	capital	is
$2	million
,
Page	868
the	balance	sheet	assets	are	worth	$16	million.	Firm	A	thus	pays
$2	million
in	excess	of	the	estimated	market	value	of	these	net	assets.	This	amount	is
the	goodwill.
3
TABLE	26.1
Accounting	for	Acquisitions:	Purchase	(in	Millions)
The	last	balance	sheet	in
Table	26.1
	shows	what	the	new	firm	looks	like
under	purchase	accounting.	Notice	that:
1. The	total	assets	of	Firm	AB	increase	to
$38	million
.	The	fixed	assets
increase	to
$30	million
.	This	is	the	sum	of	the	fixed	assets	of	Firm	A
and	the	revalued	fixed	assets	of	Firm	B	(
$16	million
	+	14	million	=
$30
million
).
2. The
$2	million
	excess	of	the	purchase	price	over	the	fair	market	value
is	reported	as	goodwill	on	the	balance	sheet.

MORE	ABOUT	GOODWILL
As	we	just	discussed,	the	purchase	method	generally	leads	to	the	creation	of
an	intangible	asset	called	goodwill.	Pre-2001	guidelines	required	firms	to
amortize	this	goodwill,	meaning	that	a	portion	of	it	was	deducted	as	an
expense	every	year	over	some	period	of	time.	In	essence,	the	goodwill,	like
any	asset,	had	to	be	depreciated	until	it	was	completely	written	off.
Despite	the	cash	flow	irrelevance	of	goodwill	amortization,	FASB’s
decision	to	require	purchase	accounting	caused	a	great	deal	of	protest,	much
of	it	due	to	the	treatment	of	goodwill	and	its	impact	on	reported	earnings.
As	a	compromise,	in	2001	FASB	eliminated	the	requirement	that	goodwill
be	amortized	and	put	in	place	a	new	rule.	In	essence,	the	new	rule	says	that

	Gains	from	Acquisitions
To	determine	the	gains	from	an	acquisition,	we	need	to	first
identify	the	relevant	incremental	cash	flows,	or,	more	generally,	the	source
of	value.	In	the	broadest	sense,	acquiring	another	firm	makes	sense	only	if
there	is	some	concrete	reason	to	believe	that	the	target	firm	will	somehow
be	worth	more	in	our	hands	than	it	is	worth	now.	As	we	will	see,	there	are	a
number	of	reasons	why	this	might	be	so.

SYNERGY
Suppose	Firm	A	is	contemplating	acquiring	Firm	B.	The	acquisition	will	be
beneficial	if	the	combined	firm	will	have	greater	value	than	the	sum	of	the
values	of	the	separate	firms.	If	we	let
V
AB
	stand	for	the	value	of	the	merged
firm,	then	the	merger	makes	sense	only	if:
V
AB
	>
V
A
	+
V
B
where
V
A
	and
V
B
	are	the	separate	values.	A	successful	merger	thus	requires
that	the	value	of	the	whole	exceed	the	sum	of	the	parts.
The	difference	between	the	value	of	the	combined	firm	and	the	sum	of
the	values	of	the	firms	as	separate	entities	is	the	incremental	net	gain	from
the	acquisition,	Δ
V
:
Δ
V
	=
V
AB
	−	(
V
A
	+
V
B
)
When	Δ
V
	is	positive,	the	acquisition	is	said	to	generate
synergy
.	For
example,	when	Comcast	announced	its	intention	to	acquire	Time	Warner
Cable	in	early	2104,	the	company	estimated	that	the	savings	in	operating
expenses	would	be	$750	million	the	first	year	and	would	eventually	reach
$1.5	billion.
synergy
The	positive	incremental	net	gain	associated	with	the	combination	of	two	firms	through	a	merger	or
acquisition.
If	Firm	A	buys	Firm	B,	it	gets	a	company	worth
V
B
	plus	the	incremental
gain,	Δ
V
.	The	value	of	Firm	B	to	Firm	A	(
)	is	thus:
Value	of	Firm	B	to	Firm
We	place	an	*	on
	to	emphasize	that	we	are	referring	to	the	value	of	Firm
B	to	Firm	A,	not	the	value	of	Firm	B	as	a	separate	entity.
	can	be	determined	in	two	steps:	(1)	estimating
V
B
	and	(2)	estimating
Δ
V
.	If	B	is	a	public	company,	then	its	market	value	as	an	independent	firm
under	existing	management	(
V
B
)	can	be	observed	directly.	If	Firm	B	is	not
publicly	owned,	then	its	value	will	have	to	be	estimated	based	on	similar
companies	that	are.	Either	way,	the	problem	of	determining	a	value	for
requires	determining	a	value	for	Δ
V
.
To	determine	the	incremental	value	of	an	acquisition,	we	need	to	know
the	incremental	cash	flows.	These	are	the	cash	flows	for	the	combined	firm
less	what	A	and	B	could	generate	separately.	In	other	words,	the
incremental	cash	flow	for	evaluating	a	merger	is	the	difference	between	the
cash	flow	of	the	combined	company	and	the	sum	of	the	cash	flows	for	the
two	companies	considered	separately.	We	will	label	this	incremental	cash
flow	as	ΔCF.
EXAMPLE	26.1
	Synergy
Firms	A	and	B	are	competitors	with	very	similar	assets	and	business
risks.	Both	are	all-equity	firms	with	aftertax	cash	flows	of	$10	per	year
forever,	and	both	have	an	overall	cost	of	capital	of	10	percent.	Firm	A	is
thinking	of	buying	Firm	B.	The	aftertax	cash	flow	from	the	merged	firm
Page	870
would	be	$21	per	year.	Does	the	merger	generate	synergy?	What	is
?
What	is	Δ
V
?
The	merger	does	generate	synergy	because	the	cash
flow	from	the	merged	firm	is	ΔCF	=	$1	greater	than	the
sum	of	the	individual	cash	flows	($21	versus	$20).
Assuming	the	risks	stay	the	same,	the	value	of	the	merged	firm	is
$21/.10	=	$210.	Firms	A	and	B	are	each	worth	$10/.10	=	$100,	for	a	total
of	$200.	The	incremental	gain	from	the	merger,	Δ
V
,	is	thus	$210	−	200	=
$10.	The	total	value	of	Firm	B	to	Firm	A,
,	is	$100	(the	value	of	B	as	a
separate	company)	plus	$10	(the	incremental	gain),	or	$110.
From	our	discussions	in	earlier	chapters,	we	know	that	the	incremental	cash
flow,	ΔCF,	can	be	broken	down	into	four	parts:
where	ΔRevenue	is	the	difference	in	revenues,	ΔCost	is	the	difference	in
costs,	ΔTax	is	the	difference	in	taxes,	and	ΔCapital	requirements	is	the
change	in	new	fixed	assets	and	net	working	capital.
Based	on	this	breakdown,	the	merger	will	make	sense	only	if	one	or	more
of	these	cash	flow	components	are	beneficially	affected	by	the	merger.	The
possible	cash	flow	benefits	of	mergers	and	acquisitions	thus	fall	into	four
basic	categories:	revenue	enhancement,	cost	reductions,	lower	taxes,	and
reductions	in	capital	needs.
REVENUE	ENHANCEMENT
One	important	reason	for	an	acquisition	is	that	the	combined	firm	may
generate	greater	revenues	than	two	separate	firms.	Increases	in	revenue	may
come	from	marketing	gains,	strategic	benefits,	and	increases	in	market
power.
Marketing	Gains
	It	is	frequently	claimed	that	mergers	and	acquisitions
can	produce	greater	operating	revenues	from	improved	marketing.	For
example,	improvements	might	be	made	in	the	following	areas:
1.	Previously	ineffective	media	programming	and	advertising	efforts.
2.	A	weak	existing	distribution	network.
3.	An	unbalanced	product	mix.
Page	871
3.	An	unbalanced	product	mix.
For	example,	in	May	2014,	Hillshire	Brands,	owner	of	such	brands	as
Jimmy	Dean	and	Sara	Lee,	announced	the	acquisition	of	Pinnacle	Foods,
owner	of	Duncan	Hines	and	Aunt	Jemima.	Hillshire	stated	that	the
combined	company	would	have	an	enhanced	scale	and	reach,	particularly	in
the	competitive	grocery	industry	(however,	despite	these	claimed	gains,	the
deal	did	not	go	through!).
Strategic	Benefits
	Some	acquisitions	promise	a	strategic	advantage.	This
is	an	opportunity	to	take	advantage	of	the	competitive	environment	if
certain	things	occur	or,	more	generally,	to	enhance	management	flexibility
with	regard	to	the	company’s	future	operations.	In	this	latter	sense,	a
strategic	benefit	is	more	like	an	option	than	a	standard	investment
opportunity.
For	example,	suppose	a	computer	manufacturer	can	use	its	technology	to
enter	other	businesses.	The	electronics	and	software	technology	from	the
original	business	can	provide	opportunities	to	begin	manufacturing
consumer	electronics	(think	Apple).
The	word
beachhead
	has	been	used	in	describing	the	process	of	entering
a	new	industry	to	exploit	perceived	opportunities.	The	beachhead	is	used	to
spawn	new	opportunities	based	on	“intangible”	relationships.	One	example
is	Procter	&	Gamble’s	initial	acquisition	of	the	Charmin	Paper	Company	as
a	beachhead,	which	allowed	Procter	&	Gamble	to
develop
a	highly	interrelated	cluster	of	paper	products—disposable
diapers,	paper	towels,	feminine	hygiene	products,	and
bathroom	tissue.
5
Market	Power
	One	firm	may	acquire	another	to	increase	its	market	share
and	market	power.	In	such	mergers,	profits	can	be	enhanced	through	higher
prices	and	reduced	competition	for	customers.	Of	course,	mergers	that
substantially	reduce	competition	in	the	market	may	be	challenged	by	the
U.S.	Department	of	Justice	or	the	Federal	Trade	Commission	on	antitrust
grounds.
COST	REDUCTIONS
One	of	the	most	basic	reasons	to	merge	is	that	a	combined	firm	may	operate
more	efficiently	than	two	separate	firms.	A	firm	can	achieve	greater
Page	872
operating	efficiency	in	several	different	ways	through	a	merger	or	an
acquisition.
Economies	of	Scale
	Economies	of	scale	relate	to	the	average	cost	per	unit
of	producing	goods	and	services.	If	the	per-unit	cost	of	production	falls	as
the	level	of	production	increases,	then	an	economy	of	scale	exists:
Frequently,	the	phrase
spreading	overhead
	is	used	in	connection	with
economies	of	scale.	This	expression	refers	to	the	sharing	of	central	facilities
such	as	corporate	headquarters,	top	management,	and	computer	services.
For	example,	in	April	2008,	when	Delta	Air	Lines	and	Northwest	Airlines
announced	a	merger	agreement,	the	companies	issued	a	statement	that	they
expected	to	generate	cost	synergies	from	more	effective	aircraft	utilization,
a	more	comprehensive	and	diversified	route	system,	and	savings	from
reduced	overhead	and	improved	operational	efficiency.
Economies	of	Vertical	Integration
	Operating	economies	can	be	gained
from	vertical	combinations	as	well	as	from	horizontal	combinations.	The
main	purpose	of	vertical	acquisitions	is	to	make	it	easier	to	coordinate
closely	related	operating	activities.	Benefits	from	vertical	integration	are
probably	why	most	forest	product	firms	that	cut	timber	also	own	sawmills
and	hauling	equipment.	Economies	of	vertical	integration	may	explain	why
some	airline	companies	have	purchased	hotels	and	car	rental	companies.
Technology	transfers	are	another	reason	for	vertical
integration.	Very	frequently,	a	company	will	decide	that
the	cheapest—and	fastest—way	to	acquire	another	firm’s
technological	skills	is	to	simply	buy	the	firm.	For	obvious	reasons,	this
rationale	is	particularly	common	in	high-tech	industries.
Complementary	Resources
	Some	firms	acquire	others	to	make	better	use
of	existing	resources	or	to	provide	the	missing	ingredient	for	success.	Think
of	a	ski	equipment	store	that	could	merge	with	a	tennis	equipment	store	to
produce	more	even	sales	over	both	the	winter	and	summer	seasons,	thereby
better	using	store	capacity.
LOWER	TAXES
Tax	gains	are	a	powerful	incentive	for	some	acquisitions.	The	possible	tax
gains	from	an	acquisition	include	the	following:
1.	The	use	of	tax	losses.
2.	The	use	of	unused	debt	capacity.
3.	The	use	of	surplus	funds.
4.	The	ability	to	write	up	the	value	of	depreciable	assets.
Net	Operating	Losses
	Firms	that	lose	money	on	a	pretax	basis	will	not
pay	taxes.	Such	firms	can	end	up	with	tax	losses	they	cannot	use.	These	tax
losses	are	referred	to	as
net	operating	losses
	(NOL).
A	firm	with	net	operating	losses	may	be	an	attractive	merger	partner	for	a
firm	with	significant	tax	liabilities.	Absent	any	other	effects,	the	combined
firm	will	have	a	lower	tax	bill	than	the	two	firms	considered	separately.
This	is	a	good	example	of	how	a	firm	can	be	more	valuable	merged	than
standing	alone.
There	are	two	qualifications	to	our	NOL	discussion:
1.	Federal	tax	laws	permit	firms	that	experience	periods	of	profit	and	loss
to	even	things	out	through	loss	carry-back	and	carry-forward	provisions.
A	firm	that	has	been	profitable	in	the	past	but	has	a	loss	in	the	current
year	can	get	refunds	of	income	taxes	paid	in	the	past	three	years.	After
that,	losses	can	be	carried	forward	for	up	to	20	years.	Thus,	a	merger	to
exploit	unused	tax	shields	must	offer	tax	savings	over	and	above	what
can	be	accomplished	by	firms	via	carry-overs.
6
2.	The	IRS	may	disallow	an	acquisition	if	the	principal	purpose	of	the
acquisition	is	to	avoid	federal	tax	by	acquiring	a	deduction	or	credit	that
would	not	otherwise	be	available.
Page	873
Unused	Debt	Capacity
	Some	firms	do	not	use	as	much	debt	as	they	are
able.	This	makes	them	potential	acquisition	candidates.	Adding	debt	can
provide	important	tax	savings,	and	many	acquisitions	are	financed	with
debt.	The	acquiring	company	can	deduct	interest	payments	on	the	newly
created	debt	and	reduce	taxes.
Surplus	Funds
	Another	quirk	in	the	tax	laws	involves	surplus	funds.
Consider	a	firm	that	has	free	cash	flow—cash	flow	available	after	all	taxes
have	been	paid	and	after	all
positive	net	present	value
projects	have	been	financed.	In	such	a	situation,	aside	from
purchasing	fixed-income	securities,	the	firm	has	several
ways	to	spend	the	free	cash	flow,	including:
1. Paying	dividends.
2. Buying	back	its	own	shares.
3. Acquiring	shares	in	another	firm.
We	discussed	the	first	two	options	in	an	earlier	chapter.	We	saw	that	an
extra	dividend	will	increase	the	income	tax	paid	by	some	investors.	A	share
repurchase	will	reduce	the	taxes	paid	by	shareholders	as	compared	to
paying	dividends,	but	this	is	not	a	legal	option	if	the	sole	purpose	is	to	avoid
taxes	that	would	have	otherwise	been	paid	by	shareholders.
To	avoid	these	problems,	the	firm	can	buy	another	firm.	By	doing	this,
the	firm	avoids	the	tax	problem	associated	with	paying	a	dividend.	Also,	the
dividends	received	from	the	purchased	firm	are	not	taxed	in	a	merger.
Asset	Write-Ups
	We	have	previously	observed	that,	in	a	taxable
acquisition,	the	assets	of	the	acquired	firm	can	be	revalued.	If	the	value	of
the	assets	increases,	tax	deductions	for	depreciation	will	be	a	benefit;	but
this	benefit	will	usually	be	more	than	offset	by	taxes	due	on	the	write-up.
REDUCTIONS	IN	CAPITAL	NEEDS
All	firms	must	invest	in	working	capital	and	fixed	assets	to	sustain	an
efficient	level	of	operating	activity.	A	merger	may	reduce	the	combined
investments	needed	by	the	two	firms.	For	example,	Firm	A	may	need	to
expand	its	manufacturing	facilities,	whereas	Firm	B	may	have	significant
excess	capacity.	It	may	be	much	cheaper	for	Firm	A	to	buy	Firm	B	than	to
build	from	scratch.
Page	874
In	addition,	acquiring	firms	may	see	ways	of	more	effectively	managing
existing	assets.	This	can	occur	with	a	reduction	in	working	capital	resulting
from	more	efficient	handling	of	cash,	accounts	receivable,	and	inventory.
Finally,	the	acquiring	firm	may	also	sell	off	certain	assets	that	are	not
needed	in	the	combined	firm.
Firms	will	often	cite	many	reasons	for	merging.	Typically,	when	firms
agree	to	merge,	they	generate	a	list	of	the	economic	benefits	that
shareholders	can	expect	from	the	merger.	For	example,	the	U.S.	Steel	and
Marathon	Oil	agreement	stated	(emphasis	added):
U.S.	Steel	believes	that	the	acquisition	of	Marathon	provides	U.S.	Steel	with	an	attractive
opportunity	to
diversify
	into	the	energy	business.	Reasons	for	the	merger	include,	but	are	not
limited	to,	the	facts	that	consummation	of	the	merger	will	allow	U.S.	Steel	to	consolidate
Marathon	in	U.S.	Steel’s	federal
income	tax	return
,	will	also	contribute	to
greater	efficiency
,
and	will	enhance	the
ability	to	manage	capital
	by	permitting	movements	of	cash	between	U.S.
Steel	and	Marathon.	Additionally,	the	merger	will
eliminate	the	possibility	of	conflicts	of
interest
	between	the	interests	of	minority	and	majority	shareholders	and	will
enhance
management	flexibility
.	The	acquisition	will	provide	Marathon	shareholders	with	a	substantial
premium	over	historic	market	prices	for	their	shares.	However,	[Marathon]	shareholders	will
no	longer	continue	to	share	in	the	future	prospects	of	the	company.
The	more	recent	merger	of	satellite	radio	providers	XM	and	Sirius	is
another	good	example.	In	the	middle	of	2008,	the	market	capitalization	of
Sirius	was	about	$3.2	billion	and	the	market	capitalization	of	XM	Radio
was	about	$2.5	billion.	Analysts	estimated	that	the	merger	could	result	in
cost	savings	with	a	present	value	of	between	$3	to	$7	billion,
potentially
more	than	the	combined	market	cap	of	the	two	companies!
Why	were	the	estimated	savings	so	large?	The	companies
gave	a	lot	of	reasons:
1. Operating	cost	savings	across	the	board:
a.
 General	and	administrative	costs.
b.
 Sales	and	marketing	costs.
c.
 Subscriber	acquisition	costs.
d.
 Research	and	development	costs.
e.
 Product	development,	manufacturing,	and	inventory	costs.
f.
 Programming	operating	infrastructure.
2. Additional	shareholder	value	in	the	longer	term	due	to	savings	on
satellite	fleet,	terrestrial	infrastructure,	and	other	capital	cost
redundancies.
3. Greater	appeal	to	large	national	advertisers	that	have	a	significant
number	of	media	alternatives.
4. Advertising	sales	expense	savings.
5. Enhanced	operating	leverage	resulting	in	accelerated	free	cash	flow
generation.
AVOIDING	MISTAKES
Evaluating	the	benefit	of	a	potential	acquisition	is	more	difficult	than	a
standard	capital	budgeting	analysis	because	so	much	of	the	value	can	come
from	intangible,	or	otherwise	difficult	to	quantify,	benefits.	Consequently,
there	is	a	great	deal	of	room	for	error.	Here	are	some	general	rules	that
should	be	remembered:
1.
Do	not	ignore	market	values:
	There	is	no	point	to,	and	little	gain	from,
estimating	the	value	of	a	publicly	traded	firm	when	that	value	can	be
directly	observed.	The	current	market	value	represents	a	consensus
opinion	of	investors	concerning	the	firm’s	value	(under	existing
management).	Use	this	value	as	a	starting	point.	If	the	firm	is	not
publicly	held,	then	the	place	to	start	is	with	similar	firms	that	are
publicly	held.
2.
Estimate	only	incremental	cash	flows:
	It	is	important	to	estimate	the
incremental	cash	flows	that	will	result	from	the	acquisition.	Only
incremental	cash	flows	from	an	acquisition	will	add	value	to	the
acquiring	firm.	Acquisition	analysis	should	thus	focus	only	on	the
newly	created,	incremental	cash	flows	from	the	proposed	acquisition.
3.
Use	the	correct	discount	rate:
	The	discount	rate	should	be	the	required
rate	of	return	for	the	incremental	cash	flows	associated	with	the
acquisition.	It	should	reflect	the	risk	associated	with	the	use	of	funds,
not	the	source.	In	particular,	if	Firm	A	is	acquiring	Firm	B,	then	Firm
A’s	cost	of	capital	is	not	particularly	relevant.	Firm	B’s	cost	of	capital	is
a	much	more	appropriate	discount	rate	because	it	reflects	the	risk	of
Firm	B’s	cash	flows.
4.
Be	aware	of	transactions	costs:
	An	acquisition	may	involve	substantial
(and	sometimes	astounding)	transactions	costs.	These	will	include	fees
to	investment	bankers,	legal	fees,	and	disclosure	requirements.
A	NOTE	ABOUT	INEFFICIENT	MANAGEMENT
Page	875
There	are	firms	whose	value	could	be	increased	with	a	change	in
management.	These	are	firms	that	are	poorly	run	or	otherwise	do	not
efficiently	use	their	assets	to	create	shareholder	value.	Mergers	are	a	means
of	replacing	management	in	such	cases.
The	fact	that	a	firm	might	benefit	from	a	change	in	management	does	not
necessarily	mean	that	existing	management	is	dishonest,	incompetent,	or
negligent.	Instead,	just	as	some	athletes	are	better	than	others,	so	might
some	management	teams	be	better	at	running	a	business.	This	can	be
particularly	true	during	times	of	technological	change	or	other
periods	when
innovations	in	business	practice	are	occurring.	In	any	case,
to	the	extent	that	corporate	“raiders”	can	identify	poorly
run	firms	or	firms	that,	for	other	reasons,	will	benefit	from
a	change	in	management,	these	raiders	provide	a	valuable	service	to	target
firm	shareholders	and	society	in	general.
Concept	Questions
26.4a
 What	are	the	relevant	incremental	cash	flows	for	evaluating	a
merger	candidate?
26.4b
 What	are	some	different	sources	of	gain	from	acquisitions?
26.5
	Some	Financial	Side	Effects	of	Acquisitions
In	addition	to	the	various	possibilities	we	have	discussed	thus	far,	mergers
can	have	some	purely	financial	side	effects—that	is,	things	that	occur
regardless	of	whether	the	merger	makes	economic	sense	or	not.	Two	such
effects	are	particularly	worth	mentioning:	EPS	growth	and	diversification.
EPS	GROWTH
An	acquisition	can	create	the	appearance	of	growth	in	earnings	per	share,	or
EPS.	This	may	fool	investors	into	thinking	that	the	firm	is	doing	better	than
it	really	is.	What	happens	is	easiest	to	see	with	an	example.
Suppose	Global	Resources,	Ltd.,	acquires	Regional	Enterprises.	The
financial	positions	of	Global	and	Regional	before	the	acquisition	are	shown
in
Table	26.2
.	We	assume	that	the	merger	creates	no	additional	value,	so	the
combined	firm	(Global	Resources	after	acquiring	Regional)	has	a	value	that
Page	876
is	equal	to	the	sum	of	the	values	of	the	two	firms	before	the	merger.
Before	the	merger,	both	Global	and	Regional	have	100	shares
outstanding.	However,	Global	sells	for
$25	per	share
,	versus	a	price	of
$10
per	share
	for	Regional.	Global	therefore	acquires	Regional	by	exchanging	1
of	its	shares	for	every	2.5	Regional	shares.	Because	there	are	100	shares	in
Regional,	this	will	take	100/2.5	=	40	shares	in	all.
After	the	merger,	Global	will	have	140	shares	outstanding,	and	several
things	will	happen	(see	the	third	column	of
Table	26.2
):
1. The	market	value	of	the	combined	firm	is
$3,500
.	This	is	equal	to	the
sum	of	the	values	of	the	separate	firms	before	the	merger.	If	the	market
is	“smart,”	it	will	realize	that	the	combined	firm	is	worth	the	sum	of	the
values	of	the	separate	firms.
TABLE	26.2
Financial	Positions	of	Global	Resources	and	Regional	Enterprises
Exchange	ratio:	1	share	in	Global	for	2.5	shares	in	Regional.
2. The	earnings	per	share	of	the	merged	firm	are
$1.43
.
The	acquisition	enables	Global	to	increase	its	earnings
per	share	from	$1	to	$1.43,	an	increase	of	43	percent.
3. Because	the	stock	price	of	Global	after	the	merger	is	the	same	as	that
before	the	merger,	the	price–earnings	ratio	must	fall.	This	is	true	as	long
as	the	market	is	smart	and	recognizes	that	the	total	market	value	has	not
been	altered	by	the	merger.
If	the	market	is	“fooled,”	it	might	mistake	the	43	percent	increase	in
earnings	per	share	for	true	growth.	In	this	case,	the	price–earnings	ratio	of
Global	may	not	fall	after	the	merger.	Suppose	the	price–earnings	ratio	of
Global	remains	equal	to	25.	Because	the	combined	firm	has	earnings	of
$200
,	the	total	value	of	the	combined	firm	will	increase	to
$5,000	(
	=
25
	×
$200)
.	The	per-share	value	for	Global	will	increase	to
$35.71	(
=
$5,000
/
140)
.
This	is	earnings	growth	magic.	Like	all	good	magic,	it	is	just	illusion.	For
it	to	work,	the	shareholders	of	Global	and	Regional	must	receive	something
for	nothing.	This,	of	course,	is	unlikely	with	so	simple	a	trick.
DIVERSIFICATION
Diversification	is	commonly	mentioned	as	a	benefit	of	a	merger.	We
previously	noted	that	U.S.	Steel	included	diversification	as	a	benefit	in
describing	its	acquisition	of	Marathon	Oil.	The	problem	is	that
diversification	per	se	probably	does	not	create	value.
Going	back	to
Chapter	13
,	recall	that	diversification	reduces
unsystematic	risk.	We	also	saw	that	the	value	of	an	asset	depends	on	its
systematic	risk,	and	systematic	risk	is	not	directly	affected	by
diversification.	Because	the	unsystematic	risk	is	not	especially	important,
there	is	no	particular	benefit	from	reducing	it.
An	easy	way	to	see	why	diversification	isn’t	an	important	benefit	of	a
merger	is	to	consider	someone	who	owned	stock	in	U.S.	Steel	and
Marathon	Oil.	Such	a	stockholder	was	already	diversified	between	these
two	investments.	The	merger	didn’t	do	anything	the	stockholders	couldn’t
do	for	themselves.
More	generally,	stockholders	can	get	all	the	diversification	they	want	by
buying	stock	in	different	companies.	As	a	result,	they	won’t	pay	a	premium
for	a	merged	company	just	for	the	benefit	of	diversification.
By	the	way,	we	are	not	saying	that	U.S.	Steel	made	a	mistake.	At	the
time	of	the	merger,	U.S.	Steel	was	a	cash-rich	company	(over	20	percent	of
its	assets	were	in	the	form	of	cash	and	marketable	securities).	It	is	not
uncommon	to	see	firms	with	surplus	cash	articulating	a	“need”	for
diversification.

	The	Cost	of	an	Acquisition
We’ve	discussed	some	of	the	benefits	of	acquisition.	We	now	need	to
discuss	the	cost	of	a	merger.
7
	We	learned	earlier	that	the	net	incremental
gain	from	a	merger	is:
Δ
V
	=
V
AB
	−	(
V
A
	+
V
B
)
Also,	the	total	value	of	Firm	B	to	Firm	A,
,	is:
The	NPV	of	the	merger	is	therefore:
To	illustrate,	suppose	we	have	the	following	premerger	information	for
Firm	A	and	Firm	B:
Both	of	these	firms	are	100	percent	equity.	You	estimate	that	the
incremental	value	of	the	acquisition,	Δ
V
,	is	$100.
The	board	of	Firm	B	has	indicated	that	it	will	agree	to	a	sale	if	the	price
is	$150,	payable	in	cash	or	stock.	This	price	for	Firm	B	has	two	parts.	Firm
B	is	worth	$100	as	a	stand-alone,	so	this	is	the	minimum	value	that	we
could	assign	to	Firm	B.	The	second	part,	$50,	is	called	the	merger	premium,
and	it	represents	the	amount	paid	above	the	stand-alone	value.
Should	Firm	A	acquire	Firm	B?	Should	it	pay	in	cash	or	stock?	To
answer,	we	need	to	determine	the	NPV	of	the	acquisition	under	both
alternatives.	We	can	start	by	noting	that	the	value	of	Firm	B	to	Firm	A	is:
The	total	value	received	by	A	as	a	result	of	buying	Firm	B	is	thus	$200.	The
question	then	is:	How	much	does	Firm	A	have	to	give	up?	The	answer
depends	on	whether	cash	or	stock	is	used	as	the	means	of	payment.
Page	878
CASE	I:	CASH	ACQUISITION
The	cost	of	an	acquisition	when	cash	is	used	is	just	the	cash	itself.	So,	if
Firm	A	pays	$150	in	cash	to	purchase	all	of	the	shares	of	Firm	B,	the	cost
of	acquiring	Firm	B	is	$150.	The	NPV	of	a	cash	acquisition	is:
The	acquisition	is	therefore	profitable.
After	the	merger,	Firm	AB	will	still	have	25	shares	outstanding.	The
value	of	Firm	A	after	the	merger	is:
This	is	just	the	premerger	value	of	$500	plus	the	$50	NPV.	The	price	per
share	after	the	merger	is	$550/25	=	$22,	representing	a	gain	of	$2	per	share.
CASE	II:	STOCK	ACQUISITION
Things	are	somewhat	more	complicated	when	stock	is	the	means	of
payment.	In	a	cash	merger,	the	shareholders	in	B	receive	cash	for	their
stock;	and,	as	in	the	U.S.	Steel–Marathon
Oil	example,
they	no	longer	participate	in	the	company.	Thus,	as	we
have	seen,	the	cost	of	the	acquisition	in	this	case	is	the
amount	of	cash	needed	to	pay	off	B’s	stockholders.
In	a	stock	merger,	no	cash	actually	changes	hands.	Instead,	the
shareholders	of	Firm	B	come	in	as	new	shareholders	in	the	merged	firm.
The	value	of	the	merged	firm	in	this	case	will	be	equal	to	the	premerger
values	of	Firms	A	and	B	plus	the	incremental	gain	from	the	merger,	Δ
V
:
To	give	$150	worth	of	stock	for	Firm	B,	Firm	A	will	have	to	give	up
$150/20	=	7.5	shares.	After	the	merger,	there	will	be	25	+	7.5	=	32.5	shares
outstanding,	and	the	per-share	value	will	be	$700/32.5	=	$21.54.
Notice	that	the	per-share	price	after	the	merger	is	lower	under	the	stock
purchase	option.	The	reason	has	to	do	with	the	fact	that	B’s	shareholders
own	stock	in	the	new	firm.
It	appears	that	Firm	A	paid	$150	for	Firm	B.	However,	it	actually	paid
more	than	that.	When	all	is	said	and	done,	B’s	stockholders	own	7.5	shares
of	stock	in	the	merged	firm.	After	the	merger,	each	of	these	shares	is	worth
$21.54.	The	total	value	of	the	consideration	received	by	B’s	stockholders	is
thus	7.5	×	$21.54	=	$161.55.
This	$161.55	is	the	true	cost	of	the	acquisition	because	it	is	what	the
sellers	actually	end	up	receiving.	The	NPV	of	the	merger	to	Firm	A	is:
We	can	check	this	by	noting	that	A	started	with	25	shares	worth	$20	each.
The	gain	to	A	of	$38.45	works	out	to	be	$38.45/25	=	$1.54	per	share.	The
value	of	the	stock	has	increased	to	$21.54,	as	we	calculated.
When	we	compare	the	cash	acquisition	to	the	stock	acquisition,	we	see
that	the	cash	acquisition	is	better	in	this	case,	because	Firm	A	gets	to	keep
all	of	the	NPV	if	it	pays	in	cash.	If	it	pays	in	stock,	Firm	B’s	stockholders
share	in	the	NPV	by	becoming	new	stockholders	in	A.
CASH	VERSUS	COMMON	STOCK
The	distinction	between	cash	and	common	stock	financing	in	a	merger	is	an
important	one.	If	cash	is	used,	the	cost	of	an	acquisition	is	not	dependent	on
the	acquisition	gains.	All	other	things	being	the	same,	if	common	stock	is
used,	the	cost	is	higher	because	Firm	A’s	shareholders	must	share	the
acquisition	gains	with	the	shareholders	of	Firm	B.	However,	if	the	NPV	of
the	acquisition	is	negative,	then	the	loss	will	be	shared	between	the	two
firms.
Whether	a	firm	should	finance	an	acquisition	with	cash	or	with	shares	of
stock	depends	on	several	factors,	including	the	following:
1.
Sharing	gains:
	If	cash	is	used	to	finance	an	acquisition,	the	selling
firm’s	shareholders	will	not	participate	in	the	potential	gains	from	the
merger.	Of	course,	if	the	acquisition	is	not	a	success,	the	losses	will	not
be	shared,	and	shareholders	of	the	acquiring	firm	will	be	worse	off	than
if	stock	had	been	used.
2.
Taxes:
	Acquisition	by	paying	cash	usually	results	in	a	taxable
transaction.	Acquisition	by	exchanging	stock	is	generally	tax-free.
3.
Control:
	Acquisition	by	paying	cash	does	not	affect	the	control	of	the
acquiring	firm.	Acquisition	with	voting	shares	may	have	implications
Page	879
for	control	of	the	merged	firm.
In	a	typical	year,	in	terms	of	the	total	number	of	deals,	cash
financing	is	much	more	common	than	stock	financing.	The
same	is	usually	true	based	on	the	total	dollar	values,	though
the	difference	is	smaller.	The	reason	is	that	stock	financing	becomes	more
common	if	we	look	at	very	large	deals.
Concept	Questions
26.6a
 Why	does	the	true	cost	of	a	stock	acquisition	depend	on	the	gain
from	the	merger?
26.6b
 What	are	some	important	factors	in	deciding	whether	to	use
stock	or	cash	in	an	acquisition?
26.7
 Defensive	Tactics
Target	firm	managers	frequently	resist	takeover	attempts.	Resistance
usually	starts	with	press	releases	and	mailings	to	shareholders	that	present
management’s	viewpoint.	It	can	eventually	lead	to	legal	action	and
solicitation	of	competing	bids.	Managerial	action	to	defeat	a	takeover
attempt	may	make	target	firm	shareholders	better	off	if	it	elicits	a	higher
offer	premium	from	the	bidding	firm	or	another	firm.
Of	course,	management	resistance	may	simply	reflect	pursuit	of	selfinterest	at	the	expense	of	shareholders.	This	is	a	controversial	subject.	At
times,	management	resistance	has	greatly	increased	the	amount	ultimately
received	by	shareholders.	At	other	times,	management	resistance	appears	to
have	defeated	all	takeover	attempts	to	the	detriment	of	shareholders.
In	this	section,	we	describe	various	defensive	tactics	that	have	been	used
by	target	firms’	management	to	resist	unfriendly	attempts.	The	law
surrounding	these	defenses	is	not	settled,	and	some	of	these	maneuvers	may
ultimately	be	deemed	illegal	or	otherwise	unsuitable.
THE	CORPORATE	CHARTER
The
corporate	charter
	consists	of	the	articles	of	incorporation	and	corporate
bylaws	that	establish	the	governance	rules	of	the	firm.	The	corporate	charter
Page	880
establishes	the	conditions	that	allow	for	a	takeover.	Firms	frequently	amend
corporate	charters	to	make	acquisitions	more	difficult.	For	example,	usually
two-thirds	(67	percent)	of	the	shareholders	of	record	must	approve	a
merger.	Firms	can	make	it	more	difficult	to	be	acquired	by	changing	this
required	percentage	to	80	percent	or	so.	Such	a	change	is	called	a
supermajority	amendment.
Another	device	is	to	stagger	the	election	of	the	board	members.	This
makes	it	more	difficult	to	elect	a	new	board	of	directors	quickly.	Such	a
board	is	sometimes	called	a
classified	board
.	We	discussed	staggered
elections	in
Chapter	8
.
REPURCHASE	AND	STANDSTILL	AGREEMENTS
Managers	of	target	firms	may	attempt	to	negotiate
standstill	agreements.
Standstill	agreements	are	contracts	wherein	the	bidding	firm	agrees	to	limit
its	holdings	in	the	target	firm.	These	agreements	usually	lead	to	the	end	of	a
takeover	attempt.
Standstill	agreements	often	occur	at	the	same	time	that	a
targeted
repurchase
	is	arranged.	In	a	targeted	repurchase,	a	firm	buys	a	certain
amount	of	its	own	stock	from	an	individual	investor,	usually	at	a	substantial
premium.	These	premiums	can	be	thought	of	as	payments	to	potential
bidders	to	eliminate	unfriendly	takeover	attempts.	Critics	of	such	payments
view	them	as	bribes	and	label	them
greenmail
.

POISON	PILLS	AND	SHARE	RIGHTS	PLANS
A
poison	pill
	is	a	tactic	designed	to	repel	would-be	suitors.
The	term	comes	from	the	world	of	espionage.	Agents	are	supposed	to	bite	a
pill	of	cyanide	rather	than	permit	capture.	Presumably,	this	prevents	enemy
interrogators	from	learning	important	secrets.
poison	pill
A	financial	device	designed	to	make	unfriendly	takeover	attempts	unappealing,	if	not	impossible.
In	the	equally	colorful	world	of	corporate	finance,	a	poison	pill	is	a
financial	device	designed	to	make	it	impossible	for	a	firm	to	be	acquired
without	management’s	consent—unless	the	buyer	is	willing	to	commit
financial	suicide.
A	majority	of	the	largest	firms	in	the	United	States	have	adopted	poison
pill	provisions	of	one	form	or	another,	often	calling	them
share	rights
plans
	(SRPs)	or	something	similar.	SRPs	differ	quite	a	bit	in	detail	from
company	to	company;	we	will	describe	a	kind	of	generic	approach	here.	In
general,	when	a	company	adopts	an	SRP,	it	distributes	share	rights	to	its
existing	stockholders.
8
	These	rights	allow	shareholders	to	buy	shares	of
stock	(or	preferred	stock)	at	some	fixed	price.
share	rights	plans
Provisions	allowing	existing	stockholders	to	purchase	stock	at	some	fixed	price	should	an	outside
takeover	bid	come	up,	discouraging	hostile	takeover	attempts.
The	rights	issued	with	an	SRP	have	a	number	of	unusual	features.	First,
the	exercise,	or	subscription,	price	on	the	right	is	usually	set	high	enough	so
that	the	rights	are	well	out	of	the	money,	meaning	that	the	purchase	price	is
much	higher	than	the	current	stock	price.	The	rights	will	often	be	good	for
10	years,	and	the	purchase,	or	exercise,	price	is	usually	a	reasonable
estimate	of	what	the	stock	will	be	worth	at	the	end	of	that	time.
In	addition,	unlike	ordinary	stock	rights,	these	rights	can’t	be	exercised
immediately,	and	they	can’t	be	bought	and	sold	separately	from	the	stock.
Also,	they	can	essentially	be	canceled	by	management	at	any	time;	often,
they	can	be	redeemed	(bought	back)	for	a	penny	apiece,	or	some	similarly
trivial	amount.
Things	get	interesting	when,	under	certain	circumstances,	the	rights	are
“triggered.”	This	means	that	the	rights	become	exercisable,	they	can	be
bought	and	sold	separately	from	the	stock,	and	they	are	not	easily	canceled
or	redeemed.	Typically,	the	rights	will	be	triggered	when	someone	acquires
20	percent	of	the	common	stock	or	announces	a	tender	offer.
When	the	rights	are	triggered,	they	can	be	exercised.	Because	they	are
out	of	the	money,	this	fact	is	not	especially	important.	Certain	other	features
come	into	play,	however.	The	most	important	is	the
flip-in	provision.
The	flip-in	provision	is	the	“poison”	in	the	pill.	In	the	event	of	an
unfriendly	takeover	attempt,	the	holder	of	a	right	can	pay	the	exercise	price
and	receive	common	stock	in	the	target	firm	worth	twice	the	exercise	price.
In	other	words,	holders	of	the	rights	can	buy	stock	in	the	target	firm	at	half
Page	881
price.	Simultaneously,	the	rights	owned	by	the	raider	(the	acquirer)	are
voided.	The	goal	of	the	flip-in	provision	is	to	massively	dilute	the	raider’s
ownership	position.
9
	Doing	so	greatly	increases	the	cost	of	the	merger	to
the	bidder	because	the	target	firm’s	shareholders	end	up	with	a	much	larger
percentage	of	the	merged	firm.
Notice	that	the	flip-in	provision	doesn’t	prevent	someone	from	acquiring
control	of	a	firm	by	purchasing	a	majority	interest.	It	just	acts	to	vastly
increase	the	cost	of	doing	so.
The	intention	of	a	poison	pill	is	to	force	a	bidder	to	negotiate	with
management.	Frequently,	merger	offers	are	made	with	the	contingency	that
the	rights	will	be	canceled	by	the	target	firm.
Some	new	varieties	of	poison	pills	have	appeared	on	the
scene	in	recent	years.	For	example,	a	“chewable”	pill,
common	in	Canada	but	not	in	the	United	States,	is	a	pill
that	is	installed	by	shareholder	vote	and	can	be	redeemed	by	shareholder
vote.	Then	there’s	the	“deadhand	pill,”	which	explicitly	gives	the	directors
who	installed	the	pill,	or	their	handpicked	successors,	the	authority	to
remove	the	pill.	This	type	of	pill	is	controversial	because	it	makes	it
virtually	impossible	for	new	directors	elected	by	stockholders	to	remove	an
existing	poison	pill.
Recently,	a	method	of	circumventing	poison	pills	has	grown	in
popularity.	Hedge	funds	or	other	large	investors,	all	of	whom	have	the	same
agenda,	such	as	removing	the	company’s	management	or	changing	the	way
the	company	operates,	band	together	and	purchase	a	large	block	of	stock.
They	then	vote	to	remove	the	board	of	directors	and	company	management
without	triggering	the	poison	pill	provision.
GOING	PRIVATE	AND	LEVERAGED	BUYOUTS
As	we	have	previously	discussed,	going	private	is	what	happens	when	the
publicly	owned	stock	in	a	firm	is	replaced	with	complete	equity	ownership
by	a	private	group,	which	may	include	elements	of	existing	management.
As	a	consequence,	the	firm’s	stock	is	taken	off	the	market	(if	it	is	an
exchange-traded	stock,	it	is	delisted)	and	is	no	longer	traded.
One	result	of	going	private	is	that	takeovers	via	tender	offer	can	no
longer	occur	because	there	are	no	publicly	held	shares.	In	this	sense,	an
LBO	(or	more	specifically,	an	MBO)	can	be	a	takeover	defense.	However,
it’s	a	defense	only	for	management.	From	the	stockholders’	point	of	view,
an	LBO	is	a	takeover	because	they	are	bought	out.
OTHER	DEVICES	AND	JARGON	OF	CORPORATE
TAKEOVERS
As	corporate	takeovers	have	become	more	common,	a	new	vocabulary	has
developed.	The	terms	are	colorful,	and,	in	no	particular	order,	some	of	them
are	listed	here:
1.
Golden	parachute:
	Some	target	firms	provide	compensation	to	toplevel	managers	if	a	takeover	occurs.	For	example,	when	Berkshire
Hathaway	and	3G	Capital	purchased	ketchup	maker	Heinz	in	2013,	it
was	reported	that	Heinz	CEO	William	Johnson	became	eligible	for	a
$212.6	million	payout	if	he	left	the	company.	The	opposite	of	a	golden
parachute	is	a	“golden	handcuff,”	which	is	an	incentive	package
designed	to	get	executives	to	stay	on	board	once	the	acquisition	is
completed.
Depending	on	your	perspective	and	the	amounts	involved,	golden
parachutes	can	be	viewed	as	a	payment	to	management	to	make	it	less
concerned	for	its	own	welfare	and	more	interested	in	stockholders
when	considering	a	takeover	bid.
2.
Poison	put:
	A	poison	put	is	a	variation	on	the	poison	pill	we	described
earlier.	A	poison	put	forces	the	firm	to	buy	securities	back	at	some	set
price.
3.
Crown	jewel:
	Firms	often	sell	or	threaten	to	sell	major	assets—crown
jewels—when	faced	with	a	takeover	threat.	This	is	sometimes	referred
to	as	the
scorched	earth
	strategy.	This	tactic	often	involves	a	lockup,
which	we	discuss	shortly.
4.
White	knight:
	A	firm	facing	an	unfriendly	merger	offer	might	arrange
to	be	acquired	by	a	different,	friendly	firm.	The	firm	is	thereby	rescued
by	a	white	knight.	Alternatively,	the	firm	may	arrange	for	a	friendly
entity	to	acquire	a	large	block	of	stock.	White	knights	can	often	increase
the	amount	paid	to	the	target	firm.	For	example,	in	2013,	Aurizon
Mines	received	a	bid	of	C$4.65	per	share	from	Alamos	Gold,	Inc.,
which	was	already	Aurizon’s	largest	shareholder.	In	response,	Aurizon
found	a	white	knight	in	Heclas	Mining,	which	purchased	Aurizon	for
C$4.75	per	share.
Page	882
So-called	white	squires	or	big	brothers	are	individuals,	firms,	or
even	mutual	funds	involved	in	friendly	transactions	of	these	types.
Sometimes	white	knights	or	others
	are	granted
exceptional	terms	or	otherwise	compensated.
Inevitably,	it	seems,	this	has	been	called
whitemail.
5.
Lockup:
	A	lockup	is	an	option	granted	to	a	friendly	suitor	(a	white
knight,	perhaps)	giving	it	the	right	to	purchase	stock	or	some	of	the
assets	(the	crown	jewels,	possibly)	of	a	target	firm	at	a	fixed	price	in	the
event	of	an	unfriendly	takeover.
6.
Shark	repellent:
	A	shark	repellent	is	any	tactic	(a	poison	pill,	for
example)	designed	to	discourage	unwanted	merger	offers.
7.
Bear	hug:
	A	bear	hug	is	an	unfriendly	takeover	offer	designed	to	be	so
attractive	that	the	target	firm’s	management	has	little	choice	but	to
accept	it.	For	example,	in	late	2013,	Charter	Cable	made	a	$38	billion
bear	hug	offer	for	Time	Warner	Cable.	Evidently	this	bear	hug	wasn’t
tight	enough	because,	in	early	2014,	Comcast	made	its	own	offer	of	$45
billion	for	Time	Warner.
8.
Fair	price	provision:
	A	fair	price	provision	is	a	requirement	that	all
selling	shareholders	receive	the	same	price	from	a	bidder.	The	provision
prevents	a	“two-tier”	offer.	In	such	a	deal,	a	bidder	offers	a	premium
price	only	for	a	percentage	of	the	shares	large	enough	to	gain	control.	It
offers	a	lower	price	for	the	remaining	shares.	Such	an	offer	can	set	off	a
stampede	among	shareholders	as	they	rush	to	get	the	better	price.
9.
Dual	class	capitalization:
	In	an	earlier	chapter,	we	noted	that	some
firms	such	as	Google	have	more	than	one	class	of	common	stock	and
that	voting	power	is	typically	concentrated	in	a	class	of	stock	not	held
by	the	public.	Such	a	capital	structure	means	that	an	unfriendly	bidder
will	not	succeed	in	gaining	control.
10.
Countertender	offer:
	Better	known	as	the	“Pac-Man”	defense,	the
target	responds	to	an	unfriendly	overture	by	offering	to	buy	the	bidder!
This	tactic	is	rarely	used,	in	part	because	target	firms	are	usually	too
small	to	realistically	purchase	the	bidder.	However,	such	a	countertender
offer	occurred	in	2013.	Jos.	A.	Bank	made	an	offer	to	acquire	Men’s
Wearhouse,	which	turned	down	the	offer.	When	Jos.	A.	Bank	pulled	the
offer,	Men’s	Wearhouse	responded	with	a	$1.5	billion	bid	for	Jos.	A.
Bank.	Finally,	after	the	offer	was	raised	to	$2.3	billion,	Jos.	A.	Bank
accepted	the	offer	in	March	2014.

 Some	Evidence	on	Acquisitions:	Does	M&A
Pay?
One	of	the	most	controversial	issues	surrounding	our	subject	is	whether
mergers	and	acquisitions	benefit	shareholders.	A	very	large	number	of
studies	have	attempted	to	estimate	the	effect	of	mergers	and	takeovers	on
stock	prices	of	the	bidding	and	target	firms.	These	studies	have	examined
the	gains	and	losses	in	stock	value	around	the	time	of	merger
announcements.
One	conclusion	that	clearly	emerges	is	that	M&A	pays	for	target	firm
shareholders.	There	is	no	mystery	here.	The	premium	typically	paid	by
bidders	represents	an	immediate,	relatively	large	gain,	often	on	the	order	of
20	percent	or	more.
Matters	become	much	more	murky	when	we	look	at
bidders,	and	different	studies	reach	different	conclusions.
One	thing	is	clear,	however.	Shareholders	in	bidder	firms
seem	to	neither	win	nor	lose	very	much,	at	least	on	average.	This	finding	is
a	bit	of	a	puzzle,	and	there	are	a	variety	of	explanations:
1. Anticipated	merger	gains	may	not	be	completely	achieved,	and
shareholders	thus	experience	losses.	This	can	happen	if	managers	of
bidding	firms	tend	to	overestimate	the	gains	from	acquisition.
2. The	bidding	firms	are	usually	much	larger	than	the	target	firms.	Thus,
even	though	the	dollar	gains	to	the	bidder	may	be	similar	to	the	dollar
gains	earned	by	shareholders	of	the	target	firm,	the	percentage	gains
will	be	much	lower.
3. Another	possible	explanation	for	the	low	returns	to	the	shareholders	of
bidding	firms	in	takeovers	is	simply	that	management	may	not	be	acting
in	the	interest	of	shareholders	when	it	attempts	to	acquire	other	firms.
Perhaps	it	is	attempting	to	increase	the	size	of	the	firm,	even	if	this
reduces	its	value	per	share.
4. The	market	for	takeovers	may	be	sufficiently	competitive	that	the	NPV
of	acquiring	is	zero	because	the	prices	paid	in	acquisitions	fully	reflect
the	value	of	the	acquired	firms.	In	other	words,	the	sellers	capture	all	of
the	gain.
5. Finally,	the	announcement	of	a	takeover	may	not	convey	much	new
information	to	the	market	about	the	bidding	firm.	This	can	occur
because	firms	frequently	announce	intentions	to	engage	in	merger
“programs”	long	before	they	announce	specific	acquisitions.	In	this
case,	the	stock	price	for	the	bidding	firm	may	already	reflect	anticipated
gains	from	mergers.

 Divestitures	and	Restructurings
In	contrast	to	a	merger	or	acquisition,	a
divestiture
	occurs	when	a	firm	sells
assets,	operations,	divisions,	and/or	segments	to	a	third	party.	Note	that
divestitures	are	an	important	part	of	M&A	activity.	After	all,	one
company’s	acquisition	is	usually	another’s	divestiture.	Also,	following	a
merger,	it	is	very	common	for	certain	assets	or	divisions	to	be	sold.	Such
sales	may	be	required	by	antitrust	regulations;	they	may	be	needed	to	raise
cash	to	help	pay	for	a	deal;	or	the	divested	units	may	simply	be	unwanted
by	the	acquirer.
divestiture
The	sale	of	assets,	operations,	divisions,	and/or	segments	of	a	business	to	a	third	party.
Divestitures	also	occur	when	a	company	decides	to	sell	off	a	part	of	itself
for	reasons	unrelated	to	mergers	and	acquisitions.	This	can	happen	when	a
particular	unit	is	unprofitable	or	not	a	good	strategic	fit.	Or,	a	firm	may
decide	to	cash	out	of	a	very	profitable	operation.	Finally,	a	cash-strapped
firm	may	have	to	sell	assets	just	to	raise	capital	(this	commonly	occurs	in
Page	884
bankruptcy).
A	divestiture	usually	occurs	like	any	other	sale.	A	company	lets	it	be
known	that	it	has	assets	for	sale	and	seeks	offers.	If	a	suitable	offer	is
forthcoming,	a	sale	occurs.
In	some	cases,	particularly	when	the	desired	divestiture	is	a	relatively
large	operating	unit,	companies	will	elect	to	do	an
equity	carve-out
.	To	do
a	carve-out,	a	parent	company
	first	creates	a	completely
separate	company	of	which	the	parent	is	the	sole
shareholder.	Next,	the	parent	company	arranges	an	initial
public	offering	(IPO)	in	which	a	fraction,	perhaps	20	percent	or	so,	of	the
parent’s	stock	is	sold	to	the	public,	thus	creating	a	publicly	held	company.
equity	carve-out
The	sale	of	stock	in	a	wholly	owned	subsidiary	via	an	IPO.
Instead	of	a	carve-out,	a	company	can	elect	to	do	a
spin-off
.	In	a	spinoff,	the	company	simply	distributes	shares	in	the	subsidiary	to	its	existing
stockholders	on	a	pro	rata	basis.	Shareholders	can	keep	the	shares	or	sell
them	as	they	see	fit.	Very	commonly,	a	company	will	first	do	an	equity
carve-out	to	create	an	active	market	for	the	shares	and	then	subsequently	do
a	spin-off	of	the	remaining	shares	at	a	later	date.	Many	well-known
companies	were	created	by	this	route.	For	example,	insurance	giant	Allstate
was	spun	off	by	Sears;	Agilent	Technologies	was	a	Hewlett-Packard	spinoff;	and	Conoco	was	once	a	part	of	DuPont.
spin-off
The	distribution	of	shares	in	a	subsidiary	to	existing	parent	company	stockholders.
In	a	less	common,	but	more	drastic	move,	a	company	can	elect	to	do	(or
be	forced	to	do)	a
split-up
.	A	split-up	is	just	what	the	name	suggests:	A
company	splits	itself	into	two	or	more	new	companies.	Shareholders	have
their	shares	in	the	old	company	swapped	for	shares	in	the	new	companies.
Probably	the	most	famous	split-up	occurred	in	the	1980s.	As	the	result	of	an
antitrust	suit	by	the	Justice	Department,	AT&T	was	forced	to	split	up
through	the	creation	of	seven	regional	phone	companies	(the	so-called	Baby
Bells).	Today,	the	Baby	Bells	survive	as	companies	such	as	Verizon.	In	an
unusual	turn	of	events,	in	2006,	SBC	Communications	acquired	its	former
parent	company,	AT&T.	In	a	nod	to	AT&T’s	history	and	name	brand
recognition,	the	new	company	kept	the	AT&T	name	even	though	SBC	was
Page	885
the	acquirer.
split-up
The	splitting	up	of	a	company	into	two	or	more	companies.
Split-ups	are	often	touted	as	a	way	of	“unlocking”	value,	meaning	a
situation	where	the	whole	is	worth	less	than	the	sum	of	the	parts.	For
example,	in	2013,	News	Corporation	announced	it	would	split	into	two
companies.	News	Corporation	would	retain	print	media	such	as
The	Wall
Street	Journal,	The	New	York	Post
,	and	HarperCollins,	while	Fox
Broadcasting,	Fox	News,	and	the	Hollywood	film	and	television	studio
would	form	21st	Century	Fox.	Also	in	2013,	Science	Applications
International	Corp.	(SAIC),	announced	that	it	would	split	into	two
companies.	After	the	split,	the	name	would	be	retained	by	the	company	that
focused	on	federal	government	contracting,	and	the	other	company	would
be	known	as	Leidos,	which	would	focus	on	energy,	security,	and	healthcare	markets.

	Summary	and
Conclusions
This	chapter	has	introduced	you	to	the	extensive	literature	on	mergers	and
acquisitions.	We	mentioned	a	number	of	issues:
1.

Forms	of	merger:
	One	firm	can	acquire	another	in	several
different	ways.	The	three	legal	forms	of	acquisition	are
merger	or	consolidation,	acquisition	of	stock,	and
acquisition	of	assets.
2.

Tax	issues:
	Mergers	and	acquisitions	can
Page	885
be	taxable	or	tax-free	transactions.	The
primary	issue	is	whether	the	target	firm’s
stockholders	sell	or	exchange	their	shares.	Generally,	a
cash	purchase	will	be	a	taxable	merger,	whereas	a	stock
exchange	will	not	be	taxable.	In	a	taxable	merger,	there	are
capital	gains	effects	and	asset	write-up	effects	to	consider.
In	a	stock	exchange,	the	target	firm’s	shareholders	become
shareholders	in	the	merged	firm.
3.

Accounting	issues:
	Accounting	for	mergers	and
acquisitions	traditionally	involved	either	the	purchase
method	or	the	pooling	of	interests	method.	In	2001,
pooling	was	eliminated	as	an	option.	As	a	result,	a	merger
or	acquisition	will	generally	result	in	the	creation	of
goodwill;	but	under	the	new	guidelines,	goodwill	does	not
have	to	be	amortized.
4.

Merger	valuation:
	If	Firm	A	is	acquiring	Firm	B,	the
benefits	(Δ
V
)	from	the	acquisition	are	defined	as	the	value
of	the	combined	firm	(
V
AB
)	less	the	value	of	the	firms	as
separate	entities	(
V
A
	and
V
B
):
Δ
V
	=
V
AB
	−	(
V
A
	+
V
B
)
The	gain	to	Firm	A	from	acquiring	Firm	B	is	the
increased	value	of	the	acquired	firm,	Δ
V
,	plus	the	value
of	B	as	a	separate	firm,
V
B
.	The	total	value	of	Firm	B	to
Firm	A,
,	is	thus:
	=	Δ
V
	+
V
B
An	acquisition	will	benefit	the	shareholders	of	the
acquiring	firm	if	this	value	is	greater	than	the	cost	of	the
acquisition.
The	cost	of	an	acquisition	can	be	defined	in	general
terms	as	the	price	paid	to	the	shareholders	of	the	acquired
firm.	The	cost	frequently	includes	a	merger	premium	paid
to	the	shareholders	of	the	acquired	firm.	Moreover,	the
cost	depends	on	the	form	of	payment—that	is,	the	choice
between	paying	with	cash	or	paying	with	common	stock.
Page	886
5.

Benefits:
	The	possible	benefits	of	an	acquisition	come
from	several	sources,	including	the	following:
a.
	Revenue	enhancement.
b.
	Cost	reductions.
c.
	Lower	taxes.
d.
	Reductions	in	capital	needs.
6.

Defensive	tactics:
	Some	of	the	most	colorful	language	of
finance	comes	from	defensive	tactics	used	in	acquisition
battles.
Poison	pills,	golden	parachutes,	crown	jewels
,	and
greenmail
	are	some	of	the	terms	that	describe	various
antitakeover	tactics.
7.

Effect	on	shareholders:
	Mergers	and	acquisitions	have
been	extensively	studied.	The	basic	conclusions	are	that,
on	average,	the	shareholders	of	target	firms	do	well,
whereas	the	shareholders	of	bidding	firms	do	not	appear	to
gain	much.
8.

Divestitures:
	For	a	variety	of	reasons,	companies	often
wish	to	sell	assets	or	operating	units.	For	relatively	large
divestitures	involving	operating	units,	firms	sometimes
elect	to	do	carve-outs,	spin-offs,	or	split-ups.

CHAPTER	REVIEW	AND	SELF-TEST
PROBLEMS
26.1 Merger	Value	and	Cost
	Consider	the	following
information	for	two	all-equity	firms,	A	and	B:
Firm	A	estimates	that	the	value	of	the	synergistic
benefit	from	acquiring	Firm	B	is	$6,000.	Firm	B	has
indicated	that	it	would	accept	a	cash	purchase	offer	of
$35	per	share.	Should	Firm	A	proceed?
26.2 Stock	Mergers	and	EPS
	Consider	the	following
information	for	two	all-equity	firms,	A	and	B:
Firm	A	is	acquiring	Firm	B	by	exchanging	100	of	its
shares	for	all	the	shares	in	B.	What	is	the	cost	of	the
merger	if	the	merged	firm	is	worth	$63,000?	What	will
happen	to	Firm	A’s	EPS?	Its	PE	ratio?
ANSWERS	TO	CHAPTER	REVIEW
AND	SELF-TEST	PROBLEMS
26.1
 The	total	value	of	Firm	B	to	Firm	A	is	the	premerger
value	of	B	plus	the	$6,000	gain	from	the	merger.	The
premerger	value	of	B	is	$30	×	6,000	=
$180,000
,	so	the
total	value	is	$186,000.	At	$35	per	share,	A	is	paying	$35
×	6,000	=
$210,000
;	the	merger	therefore	has	a	negative
Page	887
NPV	of	$186,000	−	210,000	=
−$24,000
.	At	$35	per
share,	B	is	not	an	attractive	merger	partner.
26.2
 After	the	merger,	the	firm	will	have	700	shares
outstanding.	Because	the	total	value	is	$63,000,	the	price
per	share	is	$63,000/700	=
$90
,	up	from	$70.	Because
Firm	B’s	stockholders	end	up	with	100	shares	in	the
merged	firm,	the	cost	of	the	merger	is	100	×	$90	=
$9,000
,	not	100	×	$70	=	$7,000.
Also,	the	combined	firm	will	have	$3,000	+	1,100	=
$4,100
	in	earnings,	so	EPS	will	be	$4,100/700	=
$5.86
,
up	from	$3,000/600	=	$5.	The	old	PE	ratio	was	$70/5	=
14.00.	The	new	one	is	$90/5.86	=
15.36
.

[LO1]
	In	2014,	Japanese	liquor	company
Suntory	Holdings	acquired	U.S.	bourbon	maker	Beam,
Inc.,	for	$14	billion.	Is	this	a	horizontal	or	vertical
acquisition?	How	might	Beam’s	nationality	affect	the
decision	by	Suntory?
2. Merger	Terms

3. Merger	Rationale
[LO1]
	Explain	why	diversification
per	se	is	probably	not	a	good	reason	for	merger.
4. Corporate	Split
[LO3]
	In	2014,	activist	investor	Nelson
Pelz	was	pressuring	PepsiCo	to	split	up	the	company.
Pelz	felt	that	PepsiCo	should	split	up	the	soft	drink
division,	which	includes	Pepsi,	Mountain	Dew,	and
Tropicana,	and	the	snack	food	division,	with	brands
Fritos,	Lay’s,	and	Doritos.	Why	might	investors	prefer
that	a	company	split	into	multiple	companies?	Is	there	a
possibility	of	reverse	synergy?
5. Poison	Pills
[LO1]
	Are	poison	pills	good	or	bad	for
stockholders?	How	do	you	think	acquiring	firms	are	able
to	get	around	poison	pills?
6. Merger	and	Taxes
[LO2]
	Describe	the	advantages	and
disadvantages	of	a	taxable	merger	as	opposed	to	a	taxfree	exchange.	What	is	the	basic	determinant	of	tax	status
in	a	merger?	Would	an	LBO	be	taxable	or	nontaxable?
Explain.
7. Economies	of	Scale
[LO3]
	What	does	it	mean	to	say	that
a	proposed	merger	will	take	advantage	of	available
economies	of	scale?	Suppose	Eastern	Power	Co.	and
Western	Power	Co.	are	located	in	different	time	zones.
Both	of	them	operate	at	60	percent	of	capacity	except	for
peak	periods,	when	they	operate	at	100	percent	of
capacity.	The	peak	periods	begin	at	9:00	a.m.	and	5:00
p.m.	local	time	and	last	about	45	minutes.	Explain	why	a
merger	between	Eastern	and	Western	might	make	sense.
8. Hostile	Takeovers
[LO1]
	What	types	of	actions	might
the	management	of	a	firm	take	to	fight	a	hostile
acquisition	bid	from	an	unwanted	suitor?	How	do	the
target	firm	shareholders	benefit	from	the	defensive	tactics
of	their	management	team?	How	are	the	target	firm
shareholders	harmed	by	such	actions?	Explain.
9. Merger	Offers
[LO1]
	Suppose	a	company	in	which	you
own	stock	has	attracted	two	takeover	offers.	Would	it
ever	make	sense	for	your	company’s	management	to
favor	the	lower	offer?	Does	the	form	of	payment	affect
your	answer	at	all?
10. Merger	Profit
[LO2]
	Acquiring	firm	stockholders	seem
to	benefit	very	little	from	takeovers.	Why	is	this	finding	a
Page	888
puzzle?	What	are	some	of	the	reasons	offered	for	it?

1. Calculating	Synergy
[LO3]
	Pearl,	Inc.,	has	offered	$357
million	cash	for	all	of	the	common	stock	in	Jam
Corporation.	Based	on	recent	market	information,	Jam	is
worth	$319	million	as	an	independent	operation.	If	the
merger	makes	economic
	sense	for	Pearl,
what	is	the	minimum	estimated	value	of
the	synergistic	benefits	from	the	merger?

2. Balance	Sheets	for	Mergers
[LO2]
	Consider	the
following	premerger	information	about	Firm	X	and	Firm
Y:
Assume	that	Firm	X	acquires	Firm	Y	by	paying	cash	for
all	the	shares	outstanding	at	a	merger	premium	of	$6	per
share.	Assuming	that	neither	firm	has	any	debt	before	or
after	the	merger,	construct	the	postmerger	balance	sheet
for	Firm	X	assuming	the	use	of	purchase	accounting.
3. Balance	Sheets	for	Mergers
[LO2]
	Assume	that	the
following	balance	sheets	are	stated	at	book	value.
Suppose	that	Meat	Co.	purchases	Loaf,	Inc.
The	fair	market	value	of	Loaf’s	fixed	assets	is	$9,500
versus	the	$6,700	book	value	shown.	Meat	pays	$17,300
for	Loaf	and	raises	the	needed	funds	through	an	issue	of
long-term	debt.	Construct	the	postmerger	balance	sheet
under	the	purchase	accounting	method.

4.	Balance	Sheets	for	Mergers
[LO2]
	Silver	Enterprises
has	acquired	All	Gold	Mining	in	a	merger	transaction.
Construct	the	balance	sheet	for	the	new	corporation	if	the
merger	is	treated	as	a	purchase	of	interests	for	accounting
purposes.	The	following	balance	sheets	represent	the
premerger	book	values	for	both	firms:

Page	889
The	market	value	of	All	Gold	Mining’s	fixed	assets	is
$9,100;	the	market	values	for	current	and	other	assets	are
the	same	as	the	book	values.	Assume	that	Silver
Enterprises	issues	$15,000	in	new	long-term	debt	to
finance	the	acquisition.

5.	Cash	versus	Stock	Payment
[LO3]
	Penn	Corp.	is
analyzing	the	possible	acquisition	of	Teller	Company.
Both	firms	have	no	debt.	Penn	believes	the	acquisition
will	increase	its	total	aftertax	annual	cash	flows	by	$1.9
million	indefinitely.	The	current	market	value	of	Teller	is
$41	million,	and	that	of	Penn	is	$79	million.	The
appropriate	discount	rate	for	the	incremental	cash	flows	is
10	percent.	Penn	is	trying	to	decide	whether	it	should
offer	40	percent	of	its	stock	or	$57	million	in	cash	to
Teller’s	shareholders.
a.
	What	is	the	cost	of	each	alternative?
b.
	What	is	the	NPV	of	each	alternative?

14. Calculating	NPV
[LO3]
	BQ,	Inc.,	is	considering	making
an	offer	to	purchase	iReport	Publications.	The	vice
president	of	finance	has	collected	the	following
information:
BQ	also	knows	that	securities	analysts	expect	the	earnings
and	dividends	of	iReport	to	grow	at	a	constant	rate	of	5
percent	each	year.	BQ	management	believes	that	the
acquisition	of	iReport	will	provide	the	firm	with	some
economies	of	scale	that	will	increase	this	growth	rate	to	7
percent	per	year.
a.
	What	is	the	value	of	iReport	to	BQ?
b.
	What	would	BQ’s	gain	be	from	this	acquisition?
c.
	If	BQ	were	to	offer	$38	in	cash	for	each	share	of
iReport,	what	would	the	NPV	of	the	acquisition	be?
d.
	What’s	the	most	BQ	should	be	willing	to	pay	in	cash
per	share	for	the	stock	of	iReport?
e.
	If	BQ	were	to	offer	205,000	of	its	shares	in	exchange
for	the	outstanding	stock	of	iReport,	what	would	the
NPV	be?
f.
	Should	the	acquisition	be	attempted?	If	so,	should	it
be	as	in	(c)	or	as	in	(e)?

percent	growth	rate	is	too	optimistic	and	a	6	percent
rate	is	more	realistic.	How	does	this	change	your

MINICASE
The	Birdie	Golf–Hybrid	Golf	Merger
Birdie	Golf,	Inc.,	has	been	in	merger	talks	with	Hybrid	Golf
Company	for	the	past	six	months.	After	several	rounds	of
negotiations,	the	offer	under	discussion	is	a	cash	offer	of	$250
million	for	Hybrid	Golf.	Both	companies	have	niche	markets
in	the	golf	club	industry,	and	both	believe	that	a	merger	will
Page	892
result	in	synergies	due	to	economies	of	scale	in	manufacturing
and	marketing,	as	well	as	significant	savings	in	general	and
administrative	expenses.
Bryce	Bichon,	the	financial	officer	for	Birdie,	has	been
instrumental	in	the	merger	negotiations.	Bryce	has	prepared
the	following	pro	forma	financial	statements	for	Hybrid	Golf
assuming	the	merger	takes	place.	The	financial	statements
include	all	synergistic	benefits	from	the	merger.
If	Birdie	Golf	buys	Hybrid	Golf,	an	immediate	dividend	of
$67.5	million	would	be	paid	from	Hybrid	Golf	to	Birdie.	Stock
in	Birdie	Golf	currently	sells	for	$87	per	share,	and	the
company	has	18	million	shares	of	stock	outstanding.	Hybrid
Golf	has	8	million	shares	of	stock	outstanding.	Both
companies	can	borrow	at	an	8	percent	interest	rate.	Bryce
believes	the	current	cost	of	capital	for	Birdie	Golf	is	11
percent.	The	cost	of	capital	for	Hybrid	Golf	is	12.4	percent,
and	the	cost	of	equity	is	16.9	percent.	In	five	years,	the	value
of	Hybrid	Golf	is	expected	to	be	$270	million.
Bryce	has	asked	you	to	analyze	the	financial	aspects	of	the
potential	merger.	Specifically,	he	has	asked	you	to	answer	the
following	questions.
QUESTIONS
1.	Suppose	Hybrid	shareholders	will	agree	to	a	merger	price
of	$31.25	per	share.	Should	Birdie	proceed	with	the
merger?
2.	What	is	the	highest	price	per	share	that	Birdie	should	be
2.	What	is	the	highest	price	per	share	that	Birdie	should	be
willing	to	pay	for	Hybrid?
3.	Suppose	Birdie	is	unwilling	to	pay	cash	for	the	merger	but
will	consider	a	stock	exchange.	What	exchange	ratio
would	make	the	merger	terms	equivalent	to	the	original
merger	price	of	$31.25	per	share?
4.	What	is	the	highest	exchange	ratio	Birdie	should	be
willing	to	pay	and	still	undertake	the	merger?

Remember,	there	are	assets	such	as	employee	talents,	good	customers,
growth	opportunities,	and	other	intangibles	that	don’t	show	up	on	the
balance	sheet.	The	$2	million	excess	pays	for	these.

You	might	wonder	what	would	happen	if	the	purchase	price	were	less	than
the	estimated	fair	market	value.	Amusingly,	to	be	consistent,	it	seems	that
the	accountants	would	need	to	create	a	liability	called
ill	will!
	Instead,	the
fair	market	value	is	revised	downward	to	equal	the	purchase	price.
